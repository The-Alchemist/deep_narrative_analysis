Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations. Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation.' An accessory is clothing intended to formalize or accent what is worn." ;

(1) The first example defines a pattern of the first Monday of every month for the years, 2018 and 2019. This would be specified using a :has_beginning property referencing January 2018 (a PointInTime with a :month_of_year property of 1 and a :year property of 2018) and a :has_end property referencing December 2019 (a PointInTime with a :month_of_year property of 12 and a :year property of 2019). The :has_recurrence_unit property would be set to :Months. The specific time of recurrence is defined using the :has_recurrence_time property and would reference another PointInTime instance with a :week_of_month property set to 1 (the first week of the month) and a :day_of_week set to 2 (Monday). (2) To indicate a recurrence every last Monday of the month for 2018 and 2019, all instances and property values would be defined as for (1) except that :week_of_month would be set to -1. (3) To indicate a recurrence every alternate Monday, most of the instances and property details from (1) would be valid except that :has_recurrence_unit would be :Weekly and the :week_of_month property would not be needed for the PointInTime instance referenced by the :has_recurrence_time property. However, the instance's :day_of_week property would still be set to 2. A separation_interval of 2 would be used to indicate 'alternate' weeks (every 2 weeks). (4) As a last example, consider a need to reference the rainy season(s) in some area. This would be accomplished by defining a RecurrencePattern instance with a :has_recurrence_unit of :Seasonal and a seasonal_description property set to 'rainy season'. (Other background information could be used to determine the months that are included in the 'rainy season' for the location.)" ;

Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, and warfare. In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target. While ordinary objects – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons, many are expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as clubs, axes and swords, to complicated modern firearms, tanks, intercontinental ballistic missiles, biological weapons, and cyberweapons. Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as a weaponized virus or weaponized laser.' On the other hand, ammunition '(informally ammo) is the material fired, scattered, dropped or detonated from any weapon. Ammunition is both expendable weapons (e.g., bombs, missiles, grenades, land mines) and the component parts of other weapons that create the effect on a target (e.g., bullets and warheads).[1] Nearly all mechanical weapons require some form of ammunition to operate.'(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ammunition&oldid=1012849062)" .

It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression ... Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate.' Wood substitutes include hump, bamboo, composites and plastics." .
