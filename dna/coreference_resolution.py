    Get the subject or object nouns (as indicated by the key input parameter) in the sent_dictionary,
    using the last_nouns details to attempt to resolve co-references/anaphora. Subject/object
    information (the nouns and their types) is returned.

    For example, for the sentence "Narrator was born on June 12, 1928, in Znojmo, Czechia, which was settled
    in the thirteenth century.", the sent_dictionary will be defined as {'text': 'Narrator was born ...',
    'offset': 1, 'TIMES': ['June 12, 1928', 'the thirteenth century'], 'LOCS': ['Znojmo', 'Czechia'],
