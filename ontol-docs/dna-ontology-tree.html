Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described — of which around 1 million are insects — but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. ... They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs ... Humans make use of many other animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport.'"

Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body.

In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target. While ordinary objects – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons, many are expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as clubs, axes and swords, to complicated modern firearms, tanks, intercontinental ballistic missiles, biological weapons, and cyberweapons. Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as a weaponized virus or weaponized laser.' On the other hand, ammunition '(informally ammo) is the material fired, scattered, dropped or detonated from any weapon.

The :has_recurrence_unit property would be set to :Months. The specific time of recurrence is defined using the :has_recurrence_time property and would reference another PointInTime instance with a :week_of_month property set to 1 (the first week of the month) and a :day_of_week set to 2 (Monday). (2) To indicate a recurrence every last Monday of the month for 2018 and 2019, all instances and property values would be defined as for (1) except that :week_of_month would be set to -1. (3) To indicate a recurrence every alternate Monday, most of the instances and property details from (1) would be valid except that :has_recurrence_unit would be :Weekly and the :week_of_month property would not be needed for the PointInTime instance referenced by the :has_recurrence_time property.

This would be accomplished by defining a RecurrencePattern instance with a :has_recurrence_unit of :Seasonal and a seasonal_description property set to 'rainy season'.
