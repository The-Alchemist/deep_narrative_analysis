Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described — of which around 1 million are insects — but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. ... They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs ... Humans make use of many other animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport.'" ;

Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as a weaponized virus or weaponized laser.' On the other hand, ammunition '(informally ammo) is the material fired, scattered, dropped or detonated from any weapon. Ammunition is both expendable weapons (e.g., bombs, missiles, grenades, land mines) and the component parts of other weapons that create the effect on a target (e.g., bullets and warheads). Nearly all mechanical weapons require some form of ammunition to operate.'(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ammunition&oldid=1012849062)" .

  :definition "From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wood&oldid=1009092813), Wood 'is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression ... Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate.' Wood substitutes include hump, bamboo, composites and plastics." .
