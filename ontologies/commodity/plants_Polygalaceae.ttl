  :plant_medicinal_text "Seneca snake root was employed medicinally by several native North American Indian tribes, who used it to treat a variety of complaints. It is still used in modern herbalism where it is valued mainly as an expectorant and stimulant to treat bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and whooping cough.The root contains triterpenoid saponins, these promote the clearing of phlegm from the bronchial tubes. The root is antidote, cathartic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant, sialagogue, stimulant. It was used by the North American Indians in the treatment of snake bites and has been found of use in the treatment of various respiratory problems including pleurisy and pneumonia. The root is harvested when the plant dies down in autumn and is dried for later use. Use with caution, excess doses cause diarrhoea and vomiting. See also the notes above on toxicity. A tea made from the bark has been drunk in order to bring about a miscarriage. The dried root is used as a stimulating expectorant - it is said to owe its medicinal value to the presence of saponins and in large doses is poisonous. The root is harvested in the autumn. The root has been used to treat snakebites, it is chewed and applied to the bite. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Polygala senega for cough/bronchitis (see  for critics of commission E)."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "The plant has 100 medicinal uses. The violet tree is the most popular of all the traditional medicinal plants in South Africa, where it is used for almost every conceivable ailment. It is also popularly used throughout its range. The roots are extremely poisonous, smell like wintergreen oil and contain methyl salicylate which may partly indicate why they have a wide diversity of uses, such as arrow poison in some parts of Africa including West Africa. The plant is said to have 100 medicinal uses. The roots and bark are taken orally either powdered or as infusions for treating chest complaints, headache, inflammation, abortion, ritual suicide, tuberculosis, infertility problems, venereal diseases and for constipation. Toothache can also be relieved by chewing the roots. Mixed roots of the violet tree and dwarf custard apple are used to treat gonorrhoea. Powdered roots or wood scrapings are used to treat headache by rubbing them on the forehead, while infusions from the roots are used to wash tropical ulcers. In Limpopo, the vhaVenda people use roots for mental disorders and as protection against children's illness during breastfeeding. It is also believed that many African people use the powdered violet tree roots as a sexual boost for men. The vhaVenda people mix the powdered root with mageu (maize or sorghum beverage) and it is given to a man to drink if he is sexually weak. In Zimbabwe, the roots are used to treat people who are believed to be possessed by evil spirits, for snakebite as well as for coughs when pounded with water and salt."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: An ornamental plant, it can be grown as a hedge. Other Uses:  The bark of the roots, or the pounded seeds, can be used as a soap for washing and bleaching items.  A fibre obtained from the inner bark can be used like cotton to weave a coarse cloth. The fibre obtained from young branches is particularly strong and durable. The fibre is said to be of a similar quality to flax (Linum usitatissimum). It is also used for fishing nets, baskets and strong threads that are used to sew bark cloth.  The seeds are rich in oil. It is used cosmetically or as a furniture stain.  The roots at 350 ppm are 100% effective as a molluscicide.  The wood is light yellow with markedly dark growth rings. It is soft, spongy, but durable and resists the attacks of termites. It is liable to split upon drying. Of little value, it is used for poles, hut construction, brooms etc. The wood makes a good fuel and is used to make charcoal. Ornamental."@en .
