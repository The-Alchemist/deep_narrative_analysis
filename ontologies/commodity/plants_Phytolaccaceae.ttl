  :plant_medicinal_text "A popular medicinal herb in the tropics, its pungent, garlic-like aroma (which is due to the presence of sulphur compounds) at least in part accounting for this popularity. All the parts are excessively acrid; chewing a small portion of the leaves is said to render the tongue as dry and black and rough as it appears in cases of malignant fever. The whole plant is used, or the leaves and roots separately. Many biologically active compounds have been isolated from all parts of the plant, the most important ones being sulphur compounds, but flavonoids, triterpenes and steroids have also been identified. The sulphur-containing compounds are similar to the odour compounds in garlic and onion, but in the latter they have alkyl instead of benzyl parts. Water, methanol and ethanol extracts of the whole plant have been shown to slow the growth of leukaemia cells and several other strains of cancerous tumour cells in vitro. The water extracts were toxic to leukaemia, lymphoma and several other cancer cell lines. Water extracts of the whole plant have been shown to stimulate the immune system. The hexane and cyclohexane extracts of leaves and stems increased the phagocytotic index of human granulocytes. One of the active immunomodulatory compounds present in the extracts was dibenzyl-trisulfide. A crude extract of the whole plant has shown a protective effect on blood cells infected with the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Root extracts have shown significant anti-inflammatory effects, as well as a significant pain-relieving effect. Many clinical reports and studies confirm that the extracts of the aerial parts and roots have significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties in vitro and in vivo against numerous strains of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, fungi and yeast. The crude water extracts perform in a similar way to the alcohol extracts. The whole plant is a pungent herb that is said to be abortifacient, antiseptic, antispasmodic, diuretic and febrifuge. It is believed to calm the nerves, control diarrhoea and stimulate the uterus. The plant is used in the treatment of a range of conditions. It is taken internally to treat nervous spasms, paralysis, hysteria, asthma, whooping cough, pneumonia, bronchitis, hoarseness, fevers, headaches, influenza, cystitis, venereal diseases and menstrual complaints. Taken externally, the plant is used to treat earaches, fever and headaches. It is said that a vapour bath or fumigation of the plant can restore motion to paralysed limbs. The roots are used as a remedy for toothache, and it has also been used to procure an abortion. A leaf maceration is applied to the belly to induce contractions in case of difficult delivery. The liquid from the leaves is instilled as nose or eye drops to cure violent headache, and as nose drops to cure sinusitis. A bath or vapour bath with a leaf decoction is taken in case of oedema. A leaf decoction is applied to abscesses, and is used as an analgesic against muscular pain and to treat skin diseases.. An infusion of pounded bark is drunk to treat colic, rheumatism, cancer, syphilis, colds, fever, bronchitis and asthma. Colombians chew the leaves to coat their teeth and prevent caries."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "The roots are placed among woollen goods to protect them from insects. The leaves are used as an insecticide. The leaf extract, and dibenzyl-trisulfide isolated from the roots, have shown significant acaricidal activity against the tick Boophilus microplus when topically applied, and this activity is in general higher than commercial acaricides such as dimethoate, lindane and carbaryl. Dibenzyl-trisulfide was also highly toxic to adult sweet potato weevil (Cylas formicarius elegantulus) and adult coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei). The leaf extract showed significant antifeedant activity in the grasshopper Zonocerus variegatus, as well as allelopathic activity on germinating seed."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "Various parts of the plant are widely used in traditional medicine in Africa to treat a wide range of ailments, despite the toxicity of the plant. A number of studies into the plant have been carried out and the presence of a range of medically active compounds have been shown. The leaves, fruits and roots contain numerous saponins (triterpenoid glycosides). These compounds cause haemolysis of red blood cells. On a dry weight basis, the fruit pulp contains 25% saponins; lipids (palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid and a non saponifiable bright orange, waxy material); sugars; starches; pectins and gums; and a water insoluble fraction. The roots contain saponins of the phytolaccoside or esculentoside types. These compounds have shown anti-inflammatory activity. The aqueous extract from the roots has shown fungicidal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Hydroalcoholic extracts of the aerial parts of the plant showed significant activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Histoplasma capsulatum var. Farciminosum, which causes epizootic lymphangitis. The leaf extract showed moderate activity against coxsackie virus in vitro. Butanol extracts of the fruits inhibit the growth of Trichomonas vaginalis, but fermented fruits were inactive. These extracts also showed spermatocidal properties in vitro and blastocidal activity when injected directly into the uterus of rabbits. Oral administration of a water extract of the aerial parts did not show a significant effect on reproduction in mice. The leaves and stems produce the antiviral protein dodecandrin, which is a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), similar to pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), isolated from Phytolacca americana. An extract of the roots, leaves, fruits and seeds is abortifacient, anthelmintic, diuretic, emetic, laxative, purgative and sudorific. It is used to treat oedema and intestinal problems such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The leaves and the leaf-sap are cicatrizing, haemostatic, laxative and rubefacient. A decoction is given to newborn babies as a gentle laxative. The mashed leaves are eaten with banana as a stimulant and tonic, especially after childbirth. The boiled leaves, with chicken, are given to children with asthma and tuberculosis. The sap, or the fresh, dried or powdered leaves, are applied to wounds and skin ailments such as ringworm, scabies, eczema, psoriasis, leprosy, boils and vitiligo. The leaf sap is used as eye drops to cure conjunctivitis and river blindness, and as ear drops to treat otitis. The ground leaves are applied to tumours. An infusion of the fruit or the root decoction is widely taken to induce abortion, to treat venereal diseases, bilharzia, rabies, malaria, sore throat and other respiratory problems, rheumatic pain and jaundice. The crushed roots and fruits are sometimes applied to wounds and skin ailments such as ringworm, scabies, eczema, psoriasis, leprosy, boils and vitiligo. The root decoction is drunk to cause vomiting as part of the treatment of enlarged glands. The macerated leaves or root bark are used to treat epilepsy. An infusion of the root is taken to treat infertility."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is used in Ethiopia as a hedge. Other Uses A red dye is obtained from the berries. In Zimbabwe the most common use of the fruits is to colour the floor in houses. A yellow dye is obtained from the leaves. The fruits are rich in saponins. When dried, powdered and mixed with water, they yield a foaming detergent which is traditionally used for washing clothes, and also to wash the body. The fruits are harvested when fully grown, but still green, because the saponin content is then highest. Also, ripe fruits are hard to harvest as they fall from the plant and are eaten by birds. Complete fruit bunches are collected manually. Soap has also been made from the ashes of burnt plants as well as from the fresh leaves. The saponins in the unripe fruits have been shown to have strong molluscicidal activity against a range of water snails, and are readily soluble in water and easy to isolate. These properties are useful in the destruction of these snails, which can carry vectors of human diseases such as bilharzia (schistosomiasis). They are widely used to control bilharzia-transmitting snails, as they are a cheaper and less toxic product than synthetic molluscicides. However, the saponins are not active against the egg clusters of the snails. The saponins in the fruit pulp are not actively molluscicidal until they are combined with an enzyme in the seed - to secure contact between the saponins and the enzyme, and ensure the release of the molluscicidal saponins, it is important to finely crush the fruits before soaking them in water. The molluscicidal potency remains stable over a wide range of pH (5 - 9), in the presence of various concentrations of organic and inorganic matter and also after irradiation with ultraviolet light. In acute mammalian toxicity tests the fruit extracts were classified as either non-toxic or slightly toxic, except for the eye, in which they can cause severe irritancy. Eye protection is therefore recommended during fruit crushing and handling of dry powders. Ecotoxicity tests indicated that the crushed fruits are no more toxic than currently recommended synthetic molluscicides. Toxicological studies also showed that the fruit extracts do not have mutagenic or carcinogenic properties. There are two ways of applying the fruits for snail control. The first is to make a slurry of the dried and ground fruits in water. Shortly before application the solution is diluted with river water and administered by siphoning the liquid into the river from a barrel. The rivers are treated when the water level is low and the snails are concentrated in relatively small areas. The second way is to extract the active principles only. This method is suitable for larger water bodies such as lakes, where focal application of the molluscicide is required and sprayers have to be used. In order to avoid blockage of the spray nozzle, an extract has to be prepared. The best results are obtained by soaking the dried and powdered fruits overnight and using butanol to make the extract. Green unripe fruits contain more active saponins than ripe ones. Application of the fruit and leaf extract reduced the levels of damage caused by larvae of the maize stalk borer (Busseola fusca), but 2 applications were not sufficient to provide complete protection of maize against second generation larvae. The stems are used as ties in the construction of huts and fences. The plant is usually not used as firewood, as the smoke is believed to reduce the male sexual ability."@en .
