The whole plant is a bitter tonic herb that stimulates the digestive and urinary system, and also the bowels. It also lowers blood pressure, reduces fevers and controls bacterial infections. Little used on its own, it is often taken with Dan Shen (Salvia multiorrhiza) to induce menstruation. The closely related D. chinensis has the same uses as Qu Mai and is more commonly used. The plant is abortifacient, contraceptive, diuretic, emmenagogue, ophthalmic, tonic and vulnerary. It is said to promote hair growth. It is ranked 9th in a list of 250 potential antifertility Chinese plants. The plant is taken internally in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (especially cystitis), urinary stones, constipation and failure to menstruate. Externally, it is applied to skin inflammations and swellings. The leaves are used in the treatment of haemorrhoids, lumbricoid worms, venereal sores etc. The flowers are astringent, diuretic, haemostatic, resolvent and vulnerary. Research has shown that the flowers are the most markedly diuretic part of the plant."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Soapwort's main medicinal use is as an expectorant. Its strongly irritant action within the gut is thought to stimulate the cough reflex and increase the production of a more fluid mucus within the respiratory passages. The whole plant, but especially the root, is alterative, antiscrophulatic, cholagogue, depurative, diaphoretic, mildly diuretic, expectorant, purgative, sternutatory and tonic. A decoction of the whole plant can be applied externally to treat itchy skin. The plant has proved of use in the treatment of jaundice and other visceral obstructions, but is rarely used internally in modern herbalism due to its irritant effect on the digestive system. When taken in excess, it destroys red blood cells and causes paralysis of the vasomotor centre. See also the notes above on toxicity. The root is harvested in the spring and can be dried for later use. One of the saponins in this plant is proving of interest in the treatment of cancer, it is cytotoxic to the Walker Carcinoma in vitro.

It is a gentle effective cleaner, used especially on delicate fabrics that can be harmed by modern synthetic soaps (it has been used to clean the Bayeaux tapestry). It effects a lustre in the fabric. The best soap is obtained by infusing the plant in warm water. The roots can be dried and stored for later use. The plant is sometimes recommended as a hair shampoo, though it can cause eye irritations. The plant spreads vigorously and can be used as a ground cover when planted about 1 metre apart each way."@en .
