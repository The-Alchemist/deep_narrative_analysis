  :plant_physical_characteristics "Calophyllum Brasiliense is an evergreen Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid, very alkaline and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "The resin obtained from the crushed or cut bark, called bals?mo de mar'a, has been used medicinally. A decoction of the trunk bark, combined with the root-bark of Coutarea hexandra, is used as an antidiabetic and vermifuge. The plant (part not specified) is used to dress sores, and as a headache remedy. The plant contains xanthones, including guanandine, isoguanandine and jacareubine."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: In the West Indies, it is planted as a shade tree for coffee and cacao and for windbreaks. It has been used to stabilize soils and to relieve soil compaction in degraded pastures. Other Uses Oil has been extracted from the seeds. A yellowish-green essential oil is obtained from the wood, called Sandalo Ingles in Brazil. The heartwood is pink or yellowish pink to brick red or rich reddish brown, marked with fine darker red striping; the 5 - 7cm wide band of sapwood is lighter in colour but not always clearly differentiated. The texture is medium and fairly uniform; the grain is generally interlocked but sometimes is straight; lustre is medium; odour and taste are not distinctive. The wood is moderately heavy; soft to moderately hard; strong; and fairly durable, being resistant to fungi and dry wood borers, though very susceptible to attack by drywood termites and not resistant to marine bores. It is rather slow to season, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It is rather easy to work, usually yielding smooth surfaces if straight grained though it usually tears and chips if the grain is interlocked. It is below average in planing, turning and boring; takes nails and screws well so long as it is pre-bored; glues correct. An attractive wood, it is similar to mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and has comparable uses. One of the most used woods in the American tropics, it is used for general construction, bridgework, railway ties, general wheelwright? s work, dugouts, heavy carts, canoes, general shipbuilding, shingles, flooring, interior construction, and furniture. It is a good general utility wood where a fairly strong and moderately durable timber is required. The wood produces a fair quality face veneer but is not used extensively for this purpose because of the mechanical problems in veneer-cutting operations."@en .

It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

  :plant_edible_text "Fruit - raw or cooked. A firm, thick flesh with an aromatic flavour similar to apricots. A delicious fruit, it is used as a dessert and can also be made into jams, sauces, pies, tarts etc. The flesh immediately surrounding the 2 - 4 seeds in the fruit is bitter. The fruit is rich in pectin and therefore makes good preserves, these taste remarkably like apricot preserves. The immature green fruit is high in pectin and can be added to pectin-low fruits when making jellies, jams etc. The light brown fruit is a globose to irregular berry, 10 - 20cm in diameter. The fruits can be as large as a child's head and weigh up to 2 kilos. A liqueur is distilled from the fragrant flowers. An alcoholic drink is fermented from the sap of the tree."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Uses of mamey in folk medicine include treatment of scalp infections, diarrhoea, digestive and eye problems. The powdered seeds are employed in the treatment of parasitic skin diseases. An infusion of the ground seeds, minus the embryo which is considered convulsant, is employed as an anthelmintic for adults only. The gummy latex from the bark has been used as an insecticide, to extract chiggers and insects from the skin, and to kill ticks and other parasites of dogs and other domestic animals. An aromatic liqueur called Eau de Creole or Cr√®me de Creole, is distilled from the flowers and said to act as a tonic or digestive. An infusion of the fresh or dry leaves is given in cases of intermittent fever. The plant contains coumarins, especially mammeine."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Large shade tree. Large fruiting tree, Street tree. Public open space. Agroforestry Uses: The large spreading lateral roots prevent soil erosion. Other Uses The juice of the seed leaves an indelible stain. The bark contains tannin. When twisted into the shape of a cone, the leaves are used as pots for planting tobacco seedlings and protect the young plants from root-destroying insects. The bark contains a pale yellow latex that exudes from points of damage. It has been used as an insecticide. All parts of the plant have insecticidal properties; infusions of the powdered seeds and gum from the bark and green fruit rind are used as insecticides to kill ticks, fleas and jiggers. Mammee leaves are wrapped around young tomato plants when setting them in the ground to protect them from mole crickets and cutworms. Various extracts from the fruit, bark, leaves or roots are toxic to moths, beetle larvae and also to bugs. Seed extracts are toxic to fish, chicks and hogs The heartwood is reddish or purple-brown; the sapwood much lighter in colour. Texture is medium; the grain is fine in one report, whilst another says that it is frequently interlocked and irregular; the surface of this attractive wood often is flecked with small, dark, oily, exudations. The wood is hard; heavy; strong; fairly resistant to decay but very susceptible to termites. Air-seasoning is moderate in rate but very difficult, and the amount of degrade is considerable. It is easy to work; has an attractive grain and polishes well; planing, turning, boring, and mortising are good; shaping and resistance to screw sjjlitting are excellent ; and sanding is poor. The wood is useful in cabinetwork, it is valued for pillars, rafters, decorative features of fine houses, interior sheathing, turnery and posts. The wood is used for fuel."@en .

A decoction of the flowers is drunk by women after childbirth. Qurs-e-Habis is a traditional medicine consisting of the stamens of this plant combined with the seeds of Wrightia tinctoria and the shells of pearl oysters (Pinctada margaritifera). It is used as a haemostatic, antidysenteric and antidiarrhoeal. Research has shown that the flowers exhibit antibacterial activity.

  :plant_other_use :VegetableOil ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Design: Small street tree; small flowering tree; specimen tree; Large planter or pot; Accent; Bonsai. Agroforestry Uses: The tree gives a dense shade and is an important shade provider in its distribution range. It is considered suitable for underplanting in teak plantations. Other Uses: The seeds yield up to 79% of a yellowish oil, which is inedible but is used industrially. The oil contains linoleic, oleic, stearic, and arachidic acids. It is used as a fuel for lighting. The flowers are used in dyeing for fixed colours. The fragrant flowers are used to stuff pillows and cushions and are also an ingredient of cosmetic products. The heartwood is reddish-brown with a purple tinge when fresh, becoming dark red-brown upon exposure. The wood is moderately durable; resistant to termites and insects; heavy and very hard, often blunting saws. The wood is used for heavy construction (posts, beams, rafters, joists, columns) and heavy duty flooring and furniture. It is also used for joinery, cabinet work, tool handles, agricultural implements, vehicles and boat building. Used as firewood. Resin from the bark is used to make varnish. This is a honey plant."@en .
