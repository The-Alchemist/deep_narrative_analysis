It was much employed by various native North American Indian tribes who used it to treat a wide variety of complaints including rheumatism, coughs, pox, whooping cough, asthma, internal parasites, diarrhoea and also to increase milk flow in lactating mothers. The plant is still used in modern herbalism, but it should be used with great caution, and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner if taken internally. See the notes above on toxicity. The root is cardiotonic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic and expectorant. It is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use. The fresh root is the most active part medicinally. It has been used in the treatment of syphilis and as a tonic. A weak tea made from the dried root has been used for cardiac diseases. A tea made from the root has been used as a vermifuge.

Very strong, it is used as a flax substitute, it does not shrink and it retains its strength in water. The fibre is produced late in the season, it can be harvested after the leaves fall in autumn but is probably at its best as the seed pods are forming. When making paper, the stems can be retted by leaving them in the ground until they are dry in the winter or they can be harvested in late summer, the leaves removed and the stems steamed to remove the fibre. The stems are then cooked for two hours with lye and pounded with mallets. The plant yields a latex which is a possible source of rubber. The latex is also used as a chewing gum. Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon, fiber. The dogbane-milkweed family Asclepias, Apocynum, Calotropis, and Trachomitum spp) has been used for fiber industrial crops for millennia with a number in cultivation as regional crops. All of these crops are dual-purpose fibres, offering bast fibres from the stem and seed fiber or ‘floss’ in the fruit pods. Many have also been identified as potential hydrocarbon crops due to high latex content. Could be integrated into various agroforestry systems rather than as monocultures ."@en .

It is used for heavy construction, and is recommended for high class end uses in cabinet making etc. This tree yields a timber known as 'araracanga'. We do not have any more specific information, but a general description of araracanga is as follows:- The heartwood is vermillion or deep reddish brown, sometimes with large pink veins, and constitutes about two-thirds of the bole; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 8cm wide band of almost white to light brown sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain straight or interlocked. The wood is very heavy, very hard and very durable when in contact with the soil, being very resisant to fungi and dry wood borers, and moderately resistant to termites. It is somewhay slow to season, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. It has a fairly high blunting effect and is hard to work - power tools that are stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but pre-boring is required; gluing is correct for interior purposes only. The wood has various applications, being used for purposes such as heavy bridges, railroad ties, house posts, heavy carpentry, industrial flooring, hydraulic works in fresh water etc."@en .

Agroforestry Uses: As it thrives upon soils where nothing else will grow, needing neither culture nor water, it has been considered a good plant for bringing waste land under tillage and for reclaiming drifting sands. The leaves can be used for mulching, green manuring of rice fields and for binding sandy soil. The plant is sometimes grown as a hedge. Other Uses: A fine fibre is obtained from the bark of the stems. Very strong, it is said to possess many of the qualities of flax (Linum usitatissimum), though it is somewhat finer. It is much used for making textiles, fishing nets and bowstrings. The mature seed pods contain a large quantity of floss, which has a variety of uses. For example, it can be used to stuff pillows etc or mixed with other fibres to make cloth. It is a Kapok substitute, being very water repellent it can be used as a buoyancy aid in Life Jackets or as a stuffing material. The floss absorbs oil whilst repelling water and so has also been used to mop up oil spills at sea. Candlewicks can be made from the seed floss. The twigs are used as chewsticks for cleaning the teeth. The juice is used in making a yellow dye and in tanning. The wood is sometimes used for fuel, but it is of poor quality. However, a good quality charcoal is obtained from the wood and can be used for making gunpowder. Attractive flowers are long lasting and used for floral arrangements.

Other Uses A strong fibre is obtained from the stem. Durable under water. White, silky, strong, cylindrical, flexible and durable stem fibre used for various purposes, such as for making ropes, to form cheap cots, gunny bags, bow strings, fishing nets, and in the manufacture of paper, pulp and duplicating stencils. Strong inner bark fibres produce a binding material and are processed into fabrics. The floss from the seed capsules is used as a stuffing material in mattresses etc. The floss from the seeds, which is about 2 - 3.5 cm long, white silky and strong, is used as an inferior stuffing for mattresses and pillows as well as for weaving into a strong cloth. The floss may also substitute cotton wool for surgical purposes. The plant is the source of a rubber-like product called Mudar Gummi. The liquid latex can be used as a renewable source of hydrocarbons and intermediate energy resources. The latex contains 11 - 23% of rubber. The latex is 80% effective in inhibiting the activity of the tobacco mosaic virus. The leafy branches are said to deter ants. A macerated bark extract can be used for dyes An ideal plant for monitoring sulphur dioxide emissions in the air. The stems are termite proof and are used for roofing and building huts. The very light wood can also be used for fishing net floats. The wood is a source of charcoal, used for making gunpowder. Stems produce a good charcoal, while the stem pith makes good tinder.

Tests by pharmaceutical companies in the 1950's showed the presence of a number of medically active alkaloids, especially the compound vincristine, which has been shown to have activity against leukaemia. The alkaloids, when isolated from the plant, are highly toxic but have also been shown to reduce the numbers of white blood cells, leading to applications which have revolutionized conventional cancer therapy. The plant is cultivated as a source of these alkaloids, a number of which are extracted and used allopathically. The isolated alkaloids are used to treat and other cancers. The alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine are prescribed in anticancer therapy, particularly in cases of acute leukaemia (especially in children) and Hodgkin's lymphoma. They are usually part of a complex chemotherapy protocol. Used in isolation, they have a number of side-effects, including alopecia, nausea and bone marrow depression. The dried root is an industrial source of ajmalicine, which increases the blood flow in the brain and peripheral parts of the body. Preparations of ajmalicine are used to treat the psychological and behavioural problems of senility, sensory problems (dizziness, tinnitus), cranial traumas and their neurological complications. The leaves and aerial parts of the plant have a wide range of traditional uses. Well known as an oral hypoglycaemic agent, the plant is also considered to be depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, purgative and vermifuge. A decoction is taken to treat hypertension, asthma, menstrual irregularities, chronic constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, dyspepsis, malaria, dengue fever, diabetes, cancer and skin diseases. Extracts prepared from the leaves have been applied externally as antiseptic agents for the healing of wounds; to relieve the effects of wasp stings; against haemorrhage, skin rash and as a mouthwash to treat toothache. The leaves are harvested when the plant is flowering, and can be dried for later use. An infusion of the flowers is used to treat mild diabetes. A decoction of the roots is taken to treat dysmenorrhoea."@en ;

Gutta-percha is a natural latex obtained from the sap of the tree. Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produces a hard and durable latex which can be made flexible again with hot water, but which does not become brittle. Prior to the advent of synthetic materials, gutta-percha had a wide range of uses - most particularly as an insulating material for electricity wiring and for underwater telegraph wires, a purpose for which it is very well suited since it is bio-inert and so is not attacked by marine plants or animals. Gutta-percha can be moulded into any shape and has been used to make items such as ornate furniture, pistol grips, acid-resistant receptacles and ?mourning? jewellery, where its dark colour was an advantage. It has been widely used as the core of golf balls and is still used in modern dentistry where its bio-inertness makes it ideal as a temporary filling for teeth and as a filling material inside tooth fillings. The heartwood is cream-coloured or pale brown, often with a pinkish tinge; there is no sharp demarcation from the sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain fairly straight to inter- locked; luster rather low to medium; odour and taste not distinctive. The wood is light in weight; moderately hard; natural durability is low and the wood is prone to attacks by blue-stain fungi. It is easy to both air dry and kiln dry, with little or no degrade due to warping or checking. The wood is easy to work with all tools, however there is some difficulty to generate smooth surfaces on quarter-sawn stock due to the interlocked grain; it is easy to nail and screw; and generally finishes well. The wood is used for interior millwork, general construction, furniture components, veneer for plywood, particleboard and fiberboard, boxes and crates."@en .

When the leaf is chewed, the ability to taste sweetness is lost temporarily. Studies have demonstrated that the leaf powder may exert an antidiabetic effect via a number of pathways, including decreasing the uptake of glucose from the small intestine; improvements in glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and hepatic and muscle glucose uptake; as well as the reversal of haemoglobin and plasma protein glycosylation. The plant is antidote, astringent, diuretic, emetic, hypoglycaemic, purgative, refrigerant, stomachic and tonic. It is used particularly to reduce sugar levels in the blood and urine. The leaves are used in the treatment of fevers and coughs. The powdered leaf is considered to help curb cravings for sweets and to have lipid lowering effects, it is added to food additives as a weight loss remedy. The powder also helps in preventing caries. Applied externally the leaves are combined with castor oil and used as a poultice to treat swollen glands. The roots are considered to be a useful antidote to snakebite - they are applied to the wound as a powder, made into a paste with water or given internally as a decoction.

  :plant_medicinal_text "Himatanthus sucuuba is a well respected and widely used medicinal plant in herbal medicine systems in the Amazon and South America; many of its traditional uses have been explained and verified by research. It is mainly used for treating pain and inflammation related to many conditions; cancerous tumours, and as a broad spectrum antimicrobial for various internal and external infections. Although toxic in larger doses, toxicity studies indicate that the use of the plant at traditional dosages is non-toxic. There have been no toxic, abortive, or birth defects reported. The plant contains several medically active compounds. An antitumor iridoid compound and two depsides showing inhibitory activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) have been isolated from the bark. In addition, two iridoid chemicals called plumericin and isoplumericin have been found in the bark and the latex. These two chemicals have been reported with cytotoxic, anticancer, antifungal and antibacterial actions in laboratory research. An extract of the bark has been shown to provide significant protection from ulcers and to reduce gastric hypersecretion through several novel mechanisms of actions. The latex has shown significant anti-inflammatory and pain relieving actions. The latex can exert anti-inflammatory effects even in the acute phase of the inflammatory process. This action has been attributed to the cinnamate chemicals that are found in the latex and bark. The bark has been shown to be significantly cytotoxic to five different human cancer cell lines, which may help explain why the tree has been used against cancer and tumours for many years in South America. This anti-cancerous action is probably related to the iridoids and triterpenoids in the tree bark. Research has shown that the bark has a greater antifungal effect than a control drug (nistatin) that was used - this action has been attributed to the triterpenic esters found in the bark. The plants effectiveness in treating infected wounds, candida, tuberculosis, syphilis, and even mange might be explained by the documented antimicrobial actions of the bark and latex. The plant's use in the treatment of asthma might be explained by the smooth-muscle relaxant actions documented in 2005 by Brazilian researchers working with a bark extract. The bark and the latex are considered analgesic, antiinflammatory, antirheumatic, antitumor, antifungal, anthelmintic, aphrodisiac, astringent, blood purifier, emmenagogue, emollient, febrifuge, laxative, purgative, tonic, vermifuge and vulnerary. A decoction of the bark is taken internally in the treatment of rheumatism, stomach aches and body aches and pain. Applied externally, the powdered tree bark is sprinkled directly onto stubborn wounds and sores. The latex is placed in warm water which is used to bathe the part of the body suffering from arthritis, pain and/or inflammation. The latex is also put directly onto abscesses, sores, wounds, rashes and skin ulcers. It is rubbed on to bot-fly bites in order to suffocate and kill the larvae under the skin (in both animals and humans). Both bark and latex are also used in the treatment of lymphatic gland diseases and inflammation; female disorders such as endometriosis, uterine fibroid tumours, menstrual irregularities and pain, ovarian cysts and ovarian inflammation; cancerous tumours and skin cancers; digestion problems such as indigestion, stomach aches, bowel inflammation and gastric ulcers; coughs, fevers, headaches, asthma and other lung disorders."@en ;

Combined with the root of Smilax spp., it is used to treat for tertiary syphilis. The latex contains the triterpene lupeol and derivatives of it, which possess anti-inflammatory activity. The sap, or the whole leaf-petiole rolled up into a spill, is put in the nose as a treatment for head-colds and head pains. The latex is put on wounds. The sap, or the root in decoction, is used for treating ophthalmia. A root macerate is taken to treat anuria or constipation.The powdered roots in water are taken as a stomachic. A macerate or decoction of the whole plant is used to treat urethral discharge, abdominal complaints. A macerate or decoction of the leaves is used to remedy a lack of breast-milk, impotence, gonorrhoea and stomach-ache in children."@en ;

The juice of the leaves is used to remove opacities of the cornea of the eyes and also to treat wounds and itches. The bark, leaves, and roots are used against snake and scorpion poisoning. The roots yield up to 1.3% medically active alkaloids, as well as oleoresin and the sterol serposterol. The alkaloid rauwolfine has been shown to decrease the heart rate. Several alkaloids, including serpentine, neoajmaline and isoajmaline, produce a fall in blood pressure. Serpentine also causes an increase in the tone of the small intestine and decrease in the peristaltic contractions of the intestine. The alkaloid-free oleoresin extract from the roots produces sedative and hypnotic effects. Reserpine, a highly active alkaloid, shows a very marked hypnotic effect and lowers blood pressure.

Its possession is also prohibited in Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and Australia. There has been renewed interest in iboga since the late 1990's.

  :plant_medicinal_text "Iboga root is very important in the initiation ceremonies of certain African tribes. The root bark can be eaten whole; or it can be crushed and ground then rolled into small balls; sometimes it is mixed with other ingredients; sometimes it is taken as a decoction of the crushed roots. The root is mainly employed as a hallucinogenic, a catalyst for spiritual discovery, and to seek information from ancestors and the spirit world, hence 'coming to terms with death'. Iboga is usually taken in large quantities in these ceremonies. Iboga is also taken, usually in rather smaller quantities, as a means of divination to diagnose situations and also for therapeutic purposes. The roots are considered to be aphrodisiac, febrifuge and tonic. A decoction is often taken as a means of combating tiredness, hunger and thirst in situations such as hunting when it can be necessary to overcome physical stress. A root macerate in palm wine is taken to soothe coughs, whilst the root decoction is drunk to treat urinary infections. The pounded roots are also used in the curing ceremony (called 'zebola') for treating psychosomatic afflictions. A decoction of the root is used for eye drops to treat conjunctivitis. The leaves are considered to be anaesthetic and aphrodisiac. The warmed leaves are rubbed on the gums to calm toothache. The latex obtained from the plant is taken as an anthelmintic. The active compounds, present in the root, root bark, stem bark, leaves and seeds of the plant, are indole alkaloids. About 20 have been identified so far. The highest concentrations of alkaloids occur in the root bark (5 - 6%), followed by the roots (1 - 2.5%), stem bark (2%), seed (1%) and leaves (0.4 - 0.8%). Ibogaine (ibogan class) is the most important alkaloid present in all plant parts except the seeds. The main activities of ibogaine are on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system. At low doses, it exerts primarily a stimulant effect, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue, hunger and thirst. At higher doses, the primary effects are hallucinations, with unpleasant possible side effects such as anxiety and depression with fear or rage. The peak effect is reached 1 - 3 hours after swallowing the drug; it subsides gradually, ending in complete insomnia and lethargy. These effects can last for 2 - 5 days. Apart from the psychological effects, the physical effects include tremor, light sensitivity, nausea and vomiting, loss of muscular coordination and prolonged and often painful muscle spasms, all in a dose-dependent way. Toxic doses may produce convulsions, paralysis and death from respiratory arrest. Most activities have been tested with purified ibogaine, but during initiation ceremonies powdered root bark is usually taken, which is more powerful as it contains a range of related alkaloids. Ibogaine is a potent cholinesterase inhibitor, and the root extract is even 100 times stronger in its inhibitory effect because of the additional effects of the alkaloids tabernanthine, ibogamine and the more distantly related iboluteine. This property contributes to the anti-fatigue properties of ibogaine, and results from an increased sensitivity to adrenaline, bringing about a transient excited state of the sympathic nervous system. Despite the reputation of iboga as an aphrodisiac, ibogaine did not produce a stimulation of sexual functions in various trials. Tests have not shown ibogaine to have a significant analgesic effect. Recent research indicates that ibogaine has a novel pharmacological mechanism of action, acting strongly on a variety of different receptors in the brain, resulting from complex interactions between neurotransmitter systems. There is no consensus yet on how ibogaine works precisely, but it is known to inhibit the re-uptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which can cause hallucinations. However, the suggestion by laymen that ibogaine has considerable potential in the field of psychotherapy is premature. Research has shown that ibogaine is converted in the liver to noribogaine, which fills opiate receptors, thus eliminating withdrawal symptoms. Ibogaine also stimulates nicotinic receptors in the cerebellum, which contributes to modulating the dopamine reward circuit. At high doses though, ibogaine is toxic as it destroys neurons in the cerebellum. There is evidence to suggest that ibogaine has considerable potential in treating addictions to heroin, cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, amphetamine, desoxyephedrine or methadone, or combinations of these. Several methods to arrest the physiological and psychological aspects of dependency on drugs by using ibogaine have been patented in the United States. Treatments are claimed to be effective for 70 - 100% of the cases. However, the serious side effects of ibogaine make its use potentially harmful and additional clinical studies are needed to determine if and how it can be used safely."@en ;
