It is used in salads, stews and fish dishes. Their unique texture makes them a gourmet item. Used in similar ways to potatoes. A commercially cultivated vegetable. The tubers are 2 - 8cm long and 2 - 4cm in diameter. Young tender flower spikes - cooked. The leaves are used for wrapping tamales and other foods, to which they impart flavour.

  :plant_edible_text "Root - raw or cooked. The source of a high quality edible starch, obtained by grinding the root into a fine powder. This highly digestible starch is used in pastries, biscuits etc, and is preferred to flour for thickening soups, sauces and gravies. Unlike flour, it does not add a mealy taste."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Arrowroot is a soothing demulcent and nutritive food that has traditionally been used in much the same ways as slippery elm (Ulmus rubra). Easily digested, it is of benefit to convalescents and those with weak digestions, helping to relieve acidity, indigestion and colic. It is mildly laxative. An infusion of the root has traditionally been used to treat urinary infections. The root also been used as an antidote for poison. The powdered root has been used as an ointment or poultice, especially combined with an antiseptic herb such as myrrh (Commiphora spp.). The powdered root has traditionally been made into a poultice for treating smallpox sores."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Plants can be grown as groundcover. Other Uses The starch obtained from the root is also used as a base for face powders and in certain types of glue."@en .

  :plant_edible_part :PlantSeed, :PlantLeaf ;
  :plant_edible_text "Seed - raw or cooked. A very sweet flavour. When the raw seed is chewed, it affects the taste buds so that, for about an hour thereafter, any sour foods that are eaten or drunk seem to have a sweet flavour. The seeds are also used for sweetening bread, fruits, tea etc. The aril of the seed contains a sweet-tasting protein (thaumatin) that can be used as a substitute for sugar, also in low caloric diets and drinks. Because of the persistent sweet aftertaste, it also 'sweetens' normally bitter or sour substances. Thaumatin is the sweetest of known natural and synthetic substances, 2,000 - 3,000 times sweeter than sucrose. The leaves are used for wrapping food. The report does not make it clear if the leaves are used to impart a flavour when cooking, or are merely used to wrap the food when it is stored."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The leaves are used as food wrappers, as a packing material and for roofing."@en .
