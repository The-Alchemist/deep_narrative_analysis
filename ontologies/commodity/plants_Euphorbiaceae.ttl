  :plant_medicinal_text "Iporuru has a high reputation as a medicinal herb in parts of S. America, though it is little known elsewhere. The bark and leaves are used for many different purposes and are prepared it in many different ways. However, it is especially valued for its anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties and is also widely used as an aphrodisiac and general tonic to the reproductive system. It is commonly used with other plants during shamanistic training and, sometimes, is an ingredient in ayahuasca (a hallucinogenic, multi-herb decoction used by South American shamans). The plant has been shown to contain steroids, saponins, phenols, flavonols, flavones, tannins, xanthones, and alkaloids. The anti-inflammatory properties are attributed to a group of alkaloids, including one called alchorneine, which are found in the bark of this and several other members of the genus. There has been little clinical research on the plant - despite its long history of use. That which has been done, however, does help explain some of its traditional uses. An ethanol extract of the stembark has been shown to reduce swelling and inflammation when applied topically. This extract also inhibits prostaglandin synthesis - these prostaglandins are linked to inflammatory processes and diseases and the inhibitory activity may, in part, explain the traditional use of Iporuru for treating inflammatory joint and muscle disorders such as osteoarthritis, arthritis, and rheumatism. Other research has supported Iporuru's antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor activities. An ethanol extract of the herb has proved to be much more effective than a water extract. A tincture of the bark or leaves is used as a treatment for rheumatism, arthritis, colds, and muscle pains. It relieves the symptoms of osteoarthritis, and aids flexibility of the joint and range of motion. A decoction of the bark is taken before meals to prevent diarrhoea. The crushed leaves are anodyne. They are rubbed on painful joints and are beaten into a paste to apply to painful stingray wounds. A decoction of the leaves is used as a treatment for coughs. The leaves are used to increase female fertility (mostly in cases where the male is relatively impotent). It is widely used as an aphrodisiac and geriatric tonic for males and is regarded as a remedy for impotency as well as for balancing blood sugar levels in diabetics. The plant has been gaining popularity among North American athletes and health practitioners recently; with reports suggesting that it provides nutritional support to muscle and joint structures."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Alchornea cordifolia is an important medicinal plant in African traditional medicine and much pharmacological research has been carried out into its antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal properties, as well as its anti-inflammatory activities, with significant positive results. However, the link between activity and particular compounds is often not clear, although the flavonoids and tannins seem to play a major role. More research is needed to elucidate these relations. It is probable that Alchornea cordifolia will remain a major medicinal plant. The leaves are the main part used, but the stem bark, stem pith, leafy stems, root bark, roots and fruits are also employed. In addition to the properties listed above, the leaves or leafy stems are also believed to be abortifacient, antispasmodic, blood purifier, diuretic, emetic (in large doses), emmenagogue, oxytocic, purgative, sedative and tonic. Taken as an infusion or chewed fresh, they are used to treat a wide variety of conditions including:- respiratory problems such as sore throat, cough and bronchitis; genital-urinary conditions such as venereal diseases, menstrual problems, impotency and female sterility; intestinal problems such as gastric ulcers, diarrhoea, amoebic dysentery and worms; anaemia; epilepsy; tachycardia. As a purgative, the leaves are also taken as an enema. The crushed fresh leaves or powdered dry leaves are applied externally as a cicatrizant to wounds, to relieve pain, e.g. backache and headache, to fractures to improve healing and to treat eye infections and numerous skin afflictions including venereal diseases, leprosy, sores, abscesses, yaws and filariasis. A decoction of leafy twigs is applied as a wash for feverish chills, and rheumatic pains, also for sores and as an application to sore feet as a lotion or poultice. Leaf and root decoctions are widely used as mouth wash to treat ulcers of the mouth, toothache and caries, and twigs are chewed for the same purposes. The young stem pith is bitter and astringent and is chewed in the treatment of tachycardia. The pith may also be rubbed on the chest to treat respiratory problems. The root is widely taken to treat venereal diseases, amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea. Externally, it is used to make eye drops to cure conjunctivitis. A decoction of bruised fruit is taken to prevent miscarriage. The sap of the fruit is applied externally to cure eye problems and skin diseases."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Agroforestry Uses: The tree is reported to improve soil fertility and is known to be effective in restoring calcium levels in acid soils. It is a pioneer species and is one of the first trees to appear in vegetation dominated by Chromolaena odorata, an invasive shrub that has spread widely from S. America. As a mulch crop it has good potential for restoration of soil fertility considering its standing biomass, root distribution, nutrient content in the biomass, decomposition and nutrient release patterns, and association with mycorrhiza. It is used as a windbreak around crops. Other Uses The leaves are used as a packing material for cola nuts and a Nigerian condiment. The infructescences are used in decorations. Pipe stems are made from the branches with the pith removed. The fruits are used as black dye, either on their own or combined with other plants such as fermented Parkia pods; the stems and leaves of Mucuna flagellipes; or the bark of Bridelia ferrugineas. This dye is used to colour mats and cloth and is also used on pottery, calabashes and leather. The leaves are often added to indigo to darken its colour. The leaves and fruits are used for dyeing and preserving fishing nets; dried leaves give a darker colour than fresh ones. The bark and leaves are used to blacken cloth and pottery. The bark and leaves contain up to 11% tannins. Too little for commercial interest, but the tannins are used locally for purposes such as waterproofing rope The wood ash serves as a mordant. The fruit, or an extract of the plant is a component of marine antifouling paints, coatings and polymers for application to metal surfaces. Alchorneic acid, obtained from the plant, has been proposed as a raw material for the hemi-synthesis of plastic. The wood is light, soft and perishable and is not used in many areas. However, where larger pieces are available it is sometimes used for house construction, stakes and kitchen utensils, and also benches when large stems are available The split stems are used to line baskets. The wood is also used as fuel."@en .

Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish."@en ;

Tung oil products are used to coat containers for food, beverages, and medicines; for insulating wires and other metallic surfaces, as in radios, radar, telephone and telegraph instruments. During World War II, the Chinese used tung oil for motor fuel. It tended to gum up the engines, so they processed it to make it compatible with gasoline. The mixture worked fine. The oil is very resistant to weathering. The oil is said to have insecticidal properties. The fruit contains between 14 - 20% oil, the kernel 53 - 60% and the nut 30 - 40%. The oil contains 75 - 80% a-elaeo stearic, 15% oleic-, ca 4% palmitic-, and ca 1% stearic-acids. Tannins, phytosterols, and a poisonous saponin are also reported. Trees yield 4.5 - 5 tonnes of fruit per hectare. Tung trees usually begin bearing fruit the third year after planting, and are usually in commercial production by the fourth or fifth year, attaining maximum production in 10 - 12 years. Average life of trees in United States is 30 years. Fruits mature and drop to ground in late September to early November. At this time they contain about 60% moisture. Fruits must be dried to 15% moisture before processing. Fruits should be left on ground 3 - 4 weeks until hulls are dead and dry, and the moisture content has dropped below 30%. Fruits are gathered by hand into baskets or sacks. Fruits do not deteriorate on ground until they germinate in spring."@en .

The seeds of a type grown in Vanuatu can be eaten in larger quantities without any apparent toxic effect. After removing the hard outer coat, the seed can be pounded into a meal and eaten as a sauce. The seed can be used in curries. The seed is an indispensable spice in Indonesian cuisine, where it is known as 'kemiri. It possesses little flavour of its own, but mainly acts as a flavour enhancer, being added to numerous dishes in small quantities, raw, or briefly roasted, pounded and mixed with other ingredients. In Hawaii a spice called 'inamona' is prepared from the seeds mixed with seaweed and salt. The seed needs to be stored for some time, so that they are thoroughly dried, before they are eaten. See notes above on toxicity. The residual oil cake is sometimes processed into a snack-food called 'dage kemiri' in Indonesia. It is prepared by pounding the oil cake, then soaking it for 48 hours in running water, steaming it and then covering it with a banana leaf with a weight on top of it to press out remaining liquid. It is then left to ferment for 48 hours in a dark place. Fruit. The fruit has a thick rind enclosing two large seeds surrounded by a thin layer of pulp. An oil is obtained from the seed.

The bark is used to treat wounds, tumours, bloody diarrhoea and dysentery. Bark juice, with coconut milk, is used for treating sprue. In Tonga, infertility in women is treated by daily drinking a decoction of the bark. Secondary amenorrhoea is also treated with a decoction of the bark. Thrush, sore throat, tonsillitis and mouth sores are treated in Polynesia by gargling with an infusion of the bark. The oil is purgative and sometimes used like castor oil. The irritant oil is rubbed on scalp as a hair stimulant. In the Cook Islands and Tahiti, candlenut oil is used to make a massage oil for a certain kind of headache (possibly caused by meningitis). The kernels are laxative, stimulant and sudorific. The pulped kernel is used in poultices for headache, fevers, ulcers and swollen joints. In Papua New Guinea, the seeds are applied externally to the male genitals as a contraceptive. The leaves are used to treat constipation and food poisoning. A decoction of the leaves is used in treating coughs, diarrhoea, pains in the chest and hernia. An infusion of the leaves is used as a lotion or is ingested for mouth infections of infants. The boiled leaves are used as a poultice to treat headaches and gonorrhoea."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: The tree is used in reforestation projects. Moderately fast growing, tolerant of strong winds and full sun and with a wide range of uses, it is an excellent species for use as a pioneer when restoring native woodland and establishing woodland gardens, though its ability to become naturalized in new areas means it should not be used outside areas where it is already established. It is often planted as a living fence or as a boundary marker. Other Uses The seed yields 57-80% of an inedible, semi-drying oil, liquid at ordinary temperatures, solidifying at -15 deg. C, containing oleostearic acid. The oil, quicker drying than linseed oil, has a wide range of uses, being employed in applications such as a wood preservative; for varnishes and paint oils; as an illuminant; for soap making; cosmetics; linoleum manufacture; waterproofing paper; rubber substitutes; and insulating material. It can be painted on bottoms of small crafts to protect against marine borers and also prevents feeding by striped cucumber beetle. Oil yields as high as 300 kg/ha have been reported. The seeds are so rich in oil that they have been strung together on a string and used as candles. A fast-drying oil is obtained from the seed. It is used in paints, making soap and as a lamp oil. It is suitable, with modification, for use as a substitute for diesel fuel, the residues can be converted to alcohol or burnt as a fuel. A copper-red dye is obtained from the plant (the seed?), used for decorating cloth. The powdered seed is used as an adjuvant in the manufacture of palm sugar. The seed press cake is suitable as a fertilizer. The bark contains about 4 - 6% tannin. The hardness of the seedcase is exploited in a gambling game in which the objective is to break the opponent?s stone by hitting it with one's own. In Indonesia a special cultivar is grown for this purpose. The shells of the seeds are used in making traditional garlands (?leis?). The whitish wood is fine-grained, light in weight, soft, not durable, susceptible to termite attack. It is used for general furniture, making plywood. Where the wood is abundantly available it is used for carving and to make furniture, small utensils and matches. It is suitable for paper pulp. The tree is sometimes planted as a backyard tree to supply firewood."@en .

The curative power of the sap was widely known throughout the indigenous tribes of Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador. Modern research has shown that it is a very effective treatment for a wide range of injuries and disorders, particularly relating to the skin; both internal and external ulcers; is an effective antiviral and also helps in the treatment of tumours. The resin or sap is a storehouse of phytochemicals including proanthocyanidins (antioxidants), simple phenols, diterpenes, phytosterols, and biologically active alkaloids and lignans Scientists have attributed many of the biologically active properties of the sap (especially its wound-healing capacity) to two main 'active' constituents: an alkaloid named taspine, and a lignan named dimethylcedrusine. Taspine has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antiviral actions, and to be active against the herpes virus. The lignan ?dimethylcedrusine? has been shown to play a central role in the resin?s effective wound-healing action. The study revealed that the crude resin stimulated contraction of wounds, helped in the formation of a crust/scab at the wound site, regenerated skin more rapidly, and assisted in the formation of new collagen. Other phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds, proanthocyanadins, and diterpenes, have shown potent antibacterial activity (against E. Coli and Bacillus subtilis) as well as wound-healing properties. Research has shown that the resin is a potent, cost-effective treatment for gastrointestinal ulcers and distress via antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and sensory afferent-dependent actions. The resin has also shown an in vitro effect against stomach cancer and colon cancer cells. It inhibits the growth of a human myelogenous leukaemia cell line and also prevents cells from mutating in test tube studies. The sap is antibacterial, antifungal, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antipruritic, antitumor, haemostatic and vulnerary. It is used internally in the treatment of intestinal and stomach ulcers; upper respiratory viruses; stomach viruses; and HIV. For internal use, the traditional remedy is 10 - 15 drops in a small amount of liquid, taken 1-3 times daily (be prepared, however; it tastes quite dreadful). It is taken as a douche for relieving vaginal discharge. The sap is painted on wounds to staunch bleeding, to accelerate healing, and to seal and protect injuries from infection. The sap dries quickly and forms a barrier, much like a ?second skin?. It is used as a treatment on wounds, insect bites and stings, skin disorders, fractures, and haemorrhoids., Other uses include treating inflamed or infected gums, in vaginal baths before and after childbirth, for haemorrhaging after childbirth, and for a wide range of skin disorders. For external use, the resin is rubbed directly on the affected area several times daily and allowed to dry. Please note: the resin is red! It will temporarily stain the skin a reddish-brown (which will wash off), but it will permanently stain clothing. Rubbing the resin in the palm of the hand first or directly where applied will thicken the resin into a thin, lighter coloured paste, which helps form a second skin on top of a wound or rash and reduces staining."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A natural pioneer species, it is fast-growing and also has a wide range of uses. It is a very good choice in plantings to re-establish native woodland or to set up woodland gardens. The tree is not grazed by livestock and so is often planted in hedges, live fences, shelterbelts and windbreaks. It is often retained when the forest is cleared and is used as a shade tree for coffee plantations. Croton megalocarpus trees develop a deep taproot. This makes them quite drought tolerant and allows food crops to be grown underneath. The foliage provides good mulch. The croton husks are milled for fertilizer. Croton nuts have relatively high nitrogen content comparatively to typical composts and manures. The fruit shells are used as mulch in vegetable gardens and as a component of potting mixtures. Animal feeds: Croton seed cake is used in animal feeds. Based on laboratory testing, protein accounts for 25-30% of the croton seed cake compared to comparable seed cakes like canola (18%) and sunflower (20%). The flowers provide nectar for honey bees; the honey produced is dark and has a strong flavour. Other Uses: Seed oil is tested as bio-fuel. Seeds have an oil content of about 30% and a protein content of about 50%. Oil extraction from the seed is done by hand-operated or mechanized screw presses. The oil may be refined in a continuous transesterification reactor to produce bio-fuel of diesel oil quality, with glycerol as a valuable by-product. The press-cake remaining after oil extraction can be utilized as bio-fuel and as an organic fertilizer. The seeds can be used to dye wool yellowish. The heartwood is yellowish white to brownish grey, often with irregular dark brown streaks; it is not distinctly demarcated from the 25 - 50mm wide band of sapwood. The grain is usually straight, texture medium; when freshly sawn it has an unpleasant smell. The wood is medium-weight; hard, strong, moderately durable, being slightly susceptible to termite, dry-wood borer and marine borer attack and liable to attacks by blue stain fungi. It is easy to saw and work with hand tools, but moderately difficult to machine; it usually planes to a smooth and lustrous surface; is resistant to abrasion; nailing, screwing, gluing, varnishing, painting and jointing properties are all satisfactory. The wood is only suitable for sliced veneer. The wood, most commonly known as ?musine?, is used for construction, flooring, stools, mortars, beehives, veneer and plywood. It is suitable for joinery, interior trim, ship building, vehicle bodies, furniture, cabinet work, railway sleepers and agricultural implements. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal. It is highly regarded as firewood but is not recommended for charcoal as the smoke stings the eyes. The well-dried nuts are reportedly used as a fuel in some areas, mixed with charcoal in cooking stoves."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "Extreme caution should be taken with all medical applications of this plant in view of its extreme toxicity. Only the seeds have been chemically analysed in detail. They contain 30 - 45% of a fixed oil named croton oil and about 20% protein. The composition of the oil varies with the method of extraction. The oil comprises the fatty acids oleic acid 37%, linoleic acid 19%, myristic acid 7.5%, arachidic acid 1.5%, palmitic acid 1%, formic acid 1%, acetic acid 0.5%, stearic acid 0.5% and smaller amounts of butyric acid, lauric acid, tiglic acid and valeric acid. The oil also contains a group of proteins called ?crotin?, about 3.5% croton resin (?crotonol?), a glucoside called crotonoside (isoguanosine), and a non-volatile unsaturated fatty acid responsible for the purgative properties. Croton oil causes severe inflammation on the skin. Crotin is a mixture of the toxic proteins croton globulin and croton albumin. It has haemolytic and blood coagulant properties with a delayed poisonous effect. In humans erythrocytes are merely deformed and rapid antibody formation is induced. The vesicant and irritant properties of the seed oil are mainly due to croton resin, which contains esters of long-chain fatty acids and the diterpene phorbol. Such phorbol esters also show paradoxical biological activity, some being strongly co-carcinogenic, others having anti-cancer activity. The seed and seed oil have long been used in tropical Asia as a strong purgative, cathartic and poison. In Malaysia one seed is eaten as a purgative by adults and coconut milk is drunk to stop the effect. The seed oil was formerly included in several pharmacopoeias as a purgative, but because the oil is not stable, it has proved unreliable and has therefore been excluded. The oil is a strong vesicant but diluted it can be employed as a counterirritant for various skin affections. The seed oil and bark were widely used in folk medicine as a remedy for cancerous sores and tumours, carbuncles, colds, dysentery, fever, paralysis, scabies, schistosomiasis, snakebite, sore throat and toothache. The powdered seeds mixed with dates are eaten as a purgative. The root is used as an abortifacient and purgative. The leaves are used as a poultice to treat snakebites."@en ;

Aqueous extracts of latex and stem bark showed molluscicidal activity against the freshwater snails Lymnaea acuminata and Indoplanorbis exustus; at high doses these extracts were also lethal to the freshwater fish Channa punctatus. The seed oil may also be used in the production of soap and candles. However, for illumination it can only be used outdoors as the smoke is toxic."@en .

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risks of a lethal overdose are high, particularly when treating children. Various studies have shown the presence of a range of active compounds in the plant:- Euphorbon, which is isolated from the needles, contains 4% caoutchouc. The latex yielded 75 to 82 percent resin, and 14 to 15 percent caoutchouc. The latex is rich in terpenes, including ingenol and phorbol esters. The latter, which is highly irritating, has been shown to be tumour-promoting. Six terpenes have been isolated from the plant:- cyclotirucaneol; cycloeuphordenol; tirucalicine; tirucaligine; euphorginol; and euphorcinol. The latex showed great similarity in composition and activity to the highly poisonous croton seed oil from Croton tiglium. The young branches can be roasted then chewed to relieve a sore throat. Ash from the burned branches and stems is used to treat whooping cough. The pulped twigs are applied externally to treat oedema of the legs. Ash from the burned branches and stems is applied externally as a caustic to treat open abscesses. Poultices from the stem are applied to heal broken bones. Based on the Theory of Signatures, the jointed nature of the plant-stems lead to the use of the plant in SE Asia in a belief that it will assist the healing of broken bones. A root and bud decoction is taken as a laxative, and to treat coughs and pectoral pain. A poultice of the roots or stems has been applied to ulceration of the nose, haemorrhoids and swellings. A root-decoction, combined with other drug-plants, is taken in in the treatment of schistosomiasis and gonorrhoea. The boiled root juice acts as an emetic in cases of snake bite, and is also used for sterility in women. Heated root scrapings, mixed with coconut oil, are applied externally to the stomach to relieve stomach-ache. The caustic latex is vesicant, rubefacient and counter irritant. It is purgative in small doses, emetic in larger quantities. Two or three drops at a time are given to adults with their food, whilst a dose of 3 - 4 drops is used as a purge to treat ascites and generalised oedemas. The potent purgative and emetic properties are employed in Africa in order to treat stomach complaints, constipation, intestinal worms, headache, asthma, epilepsy and palpitations. A few drops of latex are reportedly sufficient to cause vomiting, and are taken in milk as an antidote to poisoning or snakebites. Heated branches are chewed and the latex is swallowed to relieve a sore throat and dry cough, but also to induce labour during childbirth. The latex is taken in the treatment of sexual impotence and sterility in East Africa, and elsewhere as a sexual stimulant. It is also said to promote breast enlargement. The latex is used externally to treat skin-complaints, itches, insect bites, rheumatism, toothache, earache, to raise blisters on syphilitic nodes, and to remove warts, tumours, cancers, etc. It is also used for wound healing. The latex is widely used in Brazil to treat cancer, but in some areas where it is commonly used, tumours of the nose are prevalent and thought to be related to this use."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Seaside, Small flowering tree/shrub, Accent, Large planter, Bonsai, Civic centre, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: It is planted to protect sand dunes and bare soil in dry areas from wind and water erosion. E. Tirucalli fences can act as erosion breaks. It is unsuitable for intercropping since it suppresses undergrowth, including crops. An effective plant for land reclamation programmes, it is very drought resistant and efficient in photosynthesis because of its unique photosynthetic physiology combining both the Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C3 pathways. During humid spells when leaves are present, this combination allows high CO2 uptake and, thus, elevated growth rates. Plantations have succeeded in some instances at more than 5,000 ppm in arsenic mine spoil mounds. An extensively used hedge plant in rural areas of East Africa. Its dense growth and caustic, irritant sap combine to make an effective deterrent to small animals and human marauders from forcing a passage. The latex must also protect it from browsing animals though sheep and the omnivorous goat are said to eat it in some areas. The hedge can be easily established with cuttings planted in situ. Other Uses: A potential biomass crop. Its use as a source of hydrocarbons has been investigated by a number of authors, the latex hydrocarbon is largely a C30 triterpenoid which on cracking yields high octane gasoline. It is estimated that 1-2 t of crude oil can be obtained per ha per year from E. Tirucalli. The gross energy value of E. Tirucalli biomass is 17 600 kJ/kg. The biomass can be converted into gas, liquid fuels and solid fuels such as pellets, briquettes and charcoal. The sap evidently has strong fixative power: mixed with animal hair it is used for fastening knife-blades to wood handles and spear-heads to shafts. The latex is piscicidal and insecticidal. It showed strong activity against Colletotrichum capsici, Fusarium pallidoroseum, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Alternaria alternata, Penicillium citrinum, Phomopsis caricae-papayae and Aspergillus niger. The latex is highly toxic to the parasitic nematodes. Hoplolaimus indicus, Helicotylenchus indicus and Tylenchus filiformis. The plant is also used as an effective repellent for mosquitoes and ants. The latex is an emulsion of about 30% (principally euphol) terpenes in water. During the Second World War the latex was used in South Africa in the development of a rubber substitute, but this proved to be unstable and unprofitable due to the high latex resin content. Euphorbia latex contains a mixture of light hydrocarbons of molecular weight around 20,000, and after removal of the water the residue is a liquid oil. Triterpenic alcohols have also been identified in the latex. A form of rubber is obtained from the latex which contains a high proportion of resin: 14.3 - 15.7% caoutchouc, 75.8 - 82.1% resin, dry weight, in material from S Africa. The resin can be used in varnishes for certain purposes in the absence of better materials, but only at a high cost. Steam-distillation results in a better product which has found some favour in India in linseed-oil varnishes giving a tack-free glossy finish. An oil obtained from the latex was formerly used in linoleum, oilskin, and leather cloth industries. Methane can be produced by anaerobic fermentation of the latex. The wood is white, close grained and fairly hard. It is rarely attacked by insects. It is used for toys, rafters and veneers. The wood is used for fuel when better options are unavailable, and it gives a charcoal suitable for gun-powder, and for the manufacture of fireworks."@en .

After a few years under legumes, no nitrogen fertilizer may be needed, but phosphorus, magnesium and potassium may be limiting in some areas. Other Uses: Press cake or extracted meal can be used as fertilizer. A latex is obtained by tapping the trunk. The latex coagulates with the aid of acetic acid, formic acid and alum. This is the major source of natural rubber, used in a wide variety of applications including car tyres, shoes and boots, balls, elastic bands, erasers etc. It is also much used by local people to make domestic items such as water bottles, balls etc. The seeds contain a semi-drying pale yellow oil, known as Para rubber seed oil. Boiling the seed removes the poison and releases the oil, which can be used for illumination, soap making, paints and varnishes. The oil can be used as an effective treatment against houseflies and lice. The heartwood is pale cream in colour, often with a pink tinge when fresh, darkening on exposure to pale straw-coloured or pale brown, not clearly demarcated from the sapwood. The grain is straight to shallowly interlocked, texture moderately coarse but even. Sawn rubberwood often shows black stripes with the inclusion of bark material, the result of poor tapping practices with damaged or removed cambium; in freshly sawn wood there is a characteristic and distinct smell of latex. Most of the timber is used to manufacture furniture. Other uses include interior finish, moulding, e.g. For wall panelling, picture frames, drawer guides, cabinet and other handles, parquet flooring, many household utensils, block board cores, pallets, crates, coffins, veneer, and glue-laminated timber, e.g. For staircases and door and window components. Since the timber is only moderately durable when exposed to the elements, it should not be used for exterior purposes. Offcuts and other rubberwood residues have been used successfully in Malaysia for the production of particle board, wood-cement board, and medium-density fibreboard. Rubberwood was formerly regarded as a by product of the rubber plantations and used for the production of charcoal or as fuel wood, for brick making, tobacco drying and rubber drying. Rubberwood waste is an excellent medium for the growing of mushrooms, especially oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus spp.)."@en .

Modern research has supported the traditional uses. For example, the latex has antibiotic properties against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogens. It also has coagulating effects on blood plasma. A methanol extract of the leaves afforded moderate protection for cultured human lymphoblastoid cells against the cytopathic effects of the human immunodeficiency virus. The juice of the bark is used in the treatment of malarial fevers, and is also useful in reducing swellings caused by inflammation. This juice is also applied externally to treat burns, scabies, eczema and ringworm. The fresh bark is cut into small pieces and chewed or kept in the mouth for 1 - 2 hours in order to treat pyorrhoea. A paste of the bark is applied to the gums to treat wounds and swellings of the gums. The thin twigs are popularly used in Nepal as toothbrushes to treat toothache. They are considered especially good for treating bleeding and swollen gums. A leaf infusion is used as a diuretic, for bathing, to treat coughs, and as an enema in treating convulsions and fits. The leaves are also used to treat jaundice, fevers, rheumatic pains, guinea worm sores and poor development of the foetus in pregnant women. In Ghana the ashes from the burnt leaves are applied by rectal injection for treating haemorrhoids. The juice of the leaves, or the latex, is applied directly to wounds and cuts as a styptic and astringent to clean teeth, gums, and to treat sores on the tongue and in the mouth. It is also considered useful for treating decayed teeth. The seeds resemble groundnuts in flavour, and 15 - 20 seeds will cause griping, purging and vomiting for 30 minutes. It is reported from Gabon that 1 - 2 roasted seeds are sufficient to act as a purgative; larger doses may be dangerous. The seeds have been substituted for castor oil and are sometimes called 'larger castor oil'. The seeds are also used in the treatment of syphilis. The oil from the seeds, known as 'curcas'’ is a powerful purgative and emetic. The oil is widely used for treating skin diseases such as herpes, itches, eczema and boils; and also to soothe pain such as that caused by rheumatism; it is an ingredient in the oily extract, known in Hausa as 'kufi', which is a rubefacient for rheumatism and for parasitic skin conditions. The oil is used to stimulate hair growth. It is used in the treatment of . It is warmed and used to dress burns. The cotyledons are used to treat constipation and as an appetizer.

  :plant_other_use_text "Small foliage tree. Living barrier. Reclaiming deserts. Binding sand dunes. Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: The plant is widely cultivated in the tropics as a living fence in fields and settlements. It is not browsed by cattle; it can grow without protection; roots quickly from fairly large stems placed direct into the ground; and can be used as a hedge to protect fields. The plant makes an excellent hedge. The plant is used as a support for vanilla and other climbing crops. It has been planted in arid areas for soil-erosion control. Other Uses Jatropha oil is an environmentally safe, cost-effective renewable source of non-conventional energy and a promising substitute for diesel, kerosene and other fuels. Physic nut oil was used in engines in Segou, Mali, during World War II. The oil burns without smoke and has been employed for street lighting near Rio de Janeiro. The seed contains 20 - 40% of a non-volatile oil. This can also be used for lighting, whilst the cotyledons (seeds?) are used as candles. The oil is also used for making candles, soap and as an illuminant. The oil is used to prepare varnish after calcination with iron oxides. Hardened physic nut oil could be a satisfactory substitute for tallow or hardened rice bran oil. In Europe it is used in wool spinning and textile manufacture. Along with burnt plantain ashes, oil is used in making hard homemade soap. Fruit hulls and seed shells can be used as a fuel. Dried seeds dipped into palm oil are used as torches, which will keep alight even in a strong wind. The wood was used as fuel, though of poor quality, in Cape Verde. The seed press cake cannot be used in animal feed because of its toxic properties, but it is valuable as organic manure due to a nitrogen content similar to that of seed cake from castor bean and chicken manure. The nitrogen content ranges from 3.2 to 3.8%, depending on the source. Tender branches and leaves are used as a green manure for coconut trees. All plant parts can be used as a green manure. Aqueous extracts of the leaves were effective in controlling Sclerotium spp., an Azolla fungal pathogen. The seed oil, extracts of the seeds, and phorbol esters from the oil have all been used to control various pests, often with successful results. In Gabon, the seeds, ground and mixed with palm oil, are used to kill rats. The oil has purgative properties, but seeds are poisonous; even the remains from pressed seeds can be fatal. Leaf juice stains red and marks linen an indelible black. The 37% tannin found in bark is said to yield a dark blue dye; latex also contains 10% tannin and can be used as marking ink. Ashes from the roots and branches are used in the dyeing industry, and pounded seeds in tanning in Ghana. The viscid juice of the plant, when beaten, foams like soapsuds. Children often blow bubbles of it with a joint of bamboo. The bark contains a wax composed of a mixture of ‘melissyl alcohol’ and its melissimic acid ester. The branches are used as a chewing stick for cleaning the teeth and strengthening the gums."@en .

The rubber is said to be of good appearance, but the resin content, at 3 - 12%, is too high, It is, therefore, considered to be uneconomical when there are other sources. The latex can be used as a glue for paper. The seeds contain 90 % unsaturated oil. (This seems a very high figure.) The oil might possibly be used as a fuel for pre-combustion diesel engines. The wood is coarse-textured, straight-grained, very light in weight, very susceptible to wood-eating organisms. Easy to cut but of quite low quality, it is used to make items such use boxes."@en .

It is a popular shade and shelter tree in smallholder cocoa plantations. There is a belief that 'collar-crack' disease will occur on a cacao farm if the tree is cut down. When not grown in pure stands, this species has always been intercropped with coffee, cocoa or bananas. The seed contains small amounts of toxic substances, said to be a resin, which renders the residual cake unfit for use as a cattle-food though the cake should be a good nitrogenous agricultural fertiliser. The tree is used as a live fence and for erosion control. The tree could be very useful as a pioneer species - it is very fast growing, often found in secondary formations and commonly invades old farmland in its native range. Other Uses The ash of the wood is used as a source of potash for the preparation of a vegetable-salt in soap-making and in indigo dyeing. The seed contains about 47% of a light yellow drying oil with a sweet taste. It is usable in varnish and to make soft-soap, and it has industrial application in making water-proofing materials. Decortication, however, is not easy, and as the shell amounts to 37% of the weight of the seed the total amount of oil may be as low as 14% of the whole seed. The seed contains small amounts of toxic substances, said to be a resin. The seeds are used in rattles and as counters in games. The leaves areused as wrapping material. The sawdust is extraordinarily light and is suitable for use in making life-saving belts. The wood is currently recommended for use in insulation and the sawdust is no doubt suitable for sun-helmets. The heartwood is dull white to pale yellow, darkening once exposed to light; it is not clearly differentiated from the sapwood. The grain is straight to interlocked, sometimes slightly wavy; the texture coarse and even. The wood is very light in weight; very soft; fibrous; brittle; not very durable, being liable to attack by termites, powderpost beetles and marine borers. It dries rapidly with little or no degrade; shrinkage rates are low; once dry the wood is moderately stable to stable in service. The wood saws and works easily with ordinary tools - there is a great tendency to woolliness, however, and tools need to be kept very sharp; it nails and screws without splitting, but holding properties are poor; gluing is correct; turning and planing are difficult. The wood is considered to be a good substitute for balsa wood (Ochroma pyramidale); it is very buoyant and is used for fishing-net floats and rafts for heavy timbers, because of its ease of working it is carved into fetish-masks, spoons, ladles, plates, platters, bowls, dippers, stools, etc; it is also used for rough planks and coffins. The wood is used for making drums which are said to be very sonorous, and it is carved to make the whole or the resonant parts of musical instruments in various parts of Africa. The wood is perhaps suitable for paper-pulp. The wood is indifferent as a fuel, since it burns with great rapidity."@en .

Tung oil products are used to coat containers for food, beverages, and medicines; for insulating wires and other metallic surfaces, as in radios, radar, telephone and telegraph instruments. During World War II, the Chinese used tung oil for motor fuel. It tended to gum up the engines, so they processed it to make it compatible with gasoline. The mixture worked fine.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Young trees are often intercropped with food crops such as maize, groundnut or soya bean in China. In Malawi intercropping with annuals or planting of cover crops is common. Prolonged intercropping with annual crops may cause damage to the shallow root system, but in China even mature trees are sometimes intercropped with winter crops. Other Uses The seeds contain 14 - 20% of a quick-drying oil, called 'abrasin oil' or 'Chinese wood oil'. (The original text was somewhat misleading, saying that the fruit contained 14 - 20% oil, which was found in the seed, which made up 33% of the fruit. This could easily mean that the seeds themselves contain 42 - 60% oil.) Because of its similarity to 'tung oil' (from Vernicia fordii), the oils are often treated together as tung oil. The oil is used traditionally in the manufacture of paints and Chinese black ink; for waterproofing cloth and paper; caulking and painting ships; and as a lamp oil. It was also formerly used for insulating electric wires. Currently, its main use is in the production of paints and inks, while low-quality oil is processed into soap or linoleum. Teak oil which is sold for maintaining fine furniture is usually refined tung oil. Developments in environmental and health regulations have led to an increasing use of tung oil to line containers for food, beverages and medicines with an insulating coating. The main fatty acid of the oil is alpha-eleostearic acid . In eleostearic acid, the 3 double bonds are conjugated making them highly reactive. Under the influence of light or catalysts such as sulphur and iodine, alpha-eleostearic acid converts to beta-eleostearic acid, which is even more reactive and spontaneously polymerizes into a solid mass. The fatty acid composition of the oil is: _-eleostearic acid 75 - 80%, palmitic acid 4%, stearic acid about 1% and oleic acid 15%. Traditionally, the fruits are collected when still green, placed in heaps and covered with straw or grass. The fruit pulp is allowed to rot until the seeds can be easily removed. The seeds are then crushed in a mill and roasted for a short time in shallow iron pans. The crushed mass is then thoroughly steamed and subsequently the fluid is pressed out of the cake yielding commercial wood oil. In modern processing, hulling of fruits is done by hand or mechanically. The seeds are then dried and shelled mechanically, after which the kernels are ground with some shell added to facilitate oil extraction. Cold-expression is done in screw presses yielding a clear, light-coloured oil. The cake may subsequently be warm-pressed or solvent-extracted to increase the yield, but the product is of lower quality. The press cake, after extraction of the oil, is a good fertilizer, but it is poisonous and cannot be used as animal feed. The wood is white, soft and perishable. It is only suitable for simple construction, core-stock for plywood, paper pulp. The wood is used for fuel."@en .
