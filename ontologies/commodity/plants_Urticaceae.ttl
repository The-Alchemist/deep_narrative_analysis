It is used for textiles, linen etc and is said to be moth-proof. It is best harvested as the female flowers open. The outer bark is removed and then the fibrous inner bark is taken off and boiled before being woven into thread. The fibres are the longest known in the plant realm. The tensile strength is 7 times that of silk and 8 times that of cotton, this is improved on wetting the fibre. The fibre is also used for making paper. The leaves are removed from the stems, the stems are steamed and the fibres stripped off. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye, fresh material might require longer cooking, and they are then beaten in a Hollander beater before being made into paper."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Very High (5/5). Small shade tree, Large planter, Specimen, Accent, Huimid shade garden, Courtyard, Large Conservatory. Agroforestry Uses: A pioneer species, it is one of the first trees to appear in a disturbed habitat, growing rapidly and providing the ground cover necessary for the survival of less-hardy plant species. It is an ideal species to use in the initial stages of a land reclamation or reforestation program. These hardy trees grow quickly when young and they can grow in poor, eroded soils while still withstanding the full brunt of the tropical sun. They have a shallow rooting system and cast only a light shade, thus do not compete with the deeper-rooted young trees growing under their canopy. In time, they will help to provide the shade and organic material necessary to allow these other, less rugged species to survive. The trees also benefit the local ecology, for they perpetually produce flowers and fruits that are staple foodstuffs to many bird and mammal species. Other Uses The branches and leaf petioles are hollow. They can be cut and used as blow tubes or trumpets. The Uaupe Indians of the Amazon convert the hollow stems of this tree into a very curious kind of musical instrument, a species of drum, they call 'Amboobas'. A trunk, 10 - 12cm in diameter, is cut to about 1.2 metres long, removing the partitions and smoothing the inside by means of fire. They then close up the lower end with leaves beaten down into a hard mass with a pestle, and cut two holes toward the top end so as to form a handle. These rude instruments are commonly used in native dances, the performer, holding by the handle, beats the lower end upon the ground, and moves his feet in unison with the sounds thus produced. A fibre is obtained from the inner bark of young branches. Said to be very tough, it is used for sacks, strong ropes and cordage. A latex obtained from the trunk can be used to make a crude type of rubber. The spongy wood ignites easily and can be used as friction sticks to start a fire. The leaves have a rough texture and are traditionally used as a type of sandpaper to smooth the surface of Calabash fruit shells (Cresentia cujete) that are being used to make containers etc. Freshly cut, the wood is whitish or light-coloured, becoming pale brown or oatmeal coloured upon exposure. Sapwood and heartwood are not differentiated. The texture is coarse; the grain straight or fairly straight; fairly lustrous; without distinctive odour or taste. The wood is very light and soft, tough and strong for its weight, but perishable. When seasoned it is very easy to saw and machine compared with green wood. Surfaces tend to tear and fuzz in shaping and turning but gives good results in planing and sanding; it nails readily and holds screws well; it is difficult to finish with varnish or lacquer. It is used for making boxes, crates, paper pulp and matches. It is combined with cement and made into insulation board. The lightest grade of this timber should be a good substitute for the moderately heavy grades of balsa wood The trunk is used as a trough to conduct water. The soft, resilient wood of the roots resists splitting - it has been used to make tool handles."@en .

This source of drinking water is of great importance in some areas of the tree's range, where whole villages can depend upon it in dry seasons. Hunters and others break off stems to draw an impromptu drink, and even monkeys have learnt to do this. A renewed flow can be obtained by re-cutting the cut surface and beating the severed limb. Fruit. A succulent flesh with embedded small seeds. Although edible, the fruit does not seem to be much relished by local people. The yellowish-green fruit is 10 - 13 cm long by 5 - 6 cm wide. Bark-scrapings are added to fermenting sugar-cane sap to increase the potency. Wood-ash from freshly felled trees provides a vegetable salt for use in cooking."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark is intricately layered: light grey outer layer, then green, white, pink, white, all becoming brown on exposure. The outer part exudes a red-brown juice. This exudate is mixed with maize pap and then eaten in the belief that it is a galactagogue. Women who have been taking it over a period of several days experience an increased milk flow, and even those who have no child to breastfeed can experience a flow of milk. The sap of this plant has been investigated and found to contain the female hormone oestrogen and a galactagogue that can stimulate milk flow. The use of this plant to treat dysmenorrhoea may perhaps be explained by the presence of these hormones. The plant is said to have some analgesic properties and is used in the treatment of asthenia and loss of appetite. Fumigation of the bark and leaves, mixed with the leaves of Adenia lobata, acts as an expectorant and dehydrator, it is given to infants in order to relieve asthenia. A decoction of the bark-macerate is used as a treatment for pulmonary troubles. This decoction is also used as a gargle for treating toothache. A strip of the heated bark is placed over the lumbar region to relieve lumbago. The root bark, combined with kola nuts (Cola spp.) is chewed as a cure for coughs. Bark obtained from calluses on the tree is tied onto wounds where it is supposed to effect a rapid healing - although this seems a case of sympathetic treatment, perhaps it has some justification. The sap from the stilt roots is considered to be medicinal for women. Sap from the larger roots is drunk as a galactagogue; blood-purifier; to clean the stomach; and for treating blennorrhoea, cough and chest affections., The sap is applied as a wash for persons with sleeping sickness; leprosy; fevers; and to relieve aches and pains, asthenia, rheumatism etc. The root-sap is used in a topical embrocation for treating pulmonary congestion. Ash from the powdered roots, mixed with palm oil into a paste, is applied as a healing dressing to circumcision wounds. The leaf and inflorescence buds are enclosed in a red stipular sheath which may be 20 cm long. This attracts attention, in part, at least, on the Theory of Signatures, for the treatment of gynaecological conditions. To hasten childbirth, the whole sheath is boiled in soup is used as a powerful emmenagogue. The leaves are a popular medicine, especially to treat a range of feminine complaints. They are used in a prescription to prepare a vaginal douche for painful menstruation; whilst the pulped buds are given to women with leucorrhoea and other vaginal affections. The buds are crushed and boiled in water which, after filtering, is taken by draught and by enema to treat abdominal troubles. They are combined with the bark of Uapaca guineensis; pepper (either a red chilli or other pungent seed); salt and newly deposited soil from the top of a termite mound, then boiled up - the liquid after filtering is taken by mouth to treat swollen stomach and swellings in other parts of the body. The action is presumed to be diuretic. The terminal bud is crushed whole and taken, often with the sap added, to calm attacks of epilepsy and insanity, to treat blennorrhoea and heart-pains. Sap expressed from the bud is used as an eardrop for treating earache and is applied topically for localized swellings. Hairs from the inside of the stipule are considered good for healing burns and sores. The catkins are cooked with groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea) and are taken to facilitate childbirth."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A pioneer plant of rapid growth, but short-lived; often gregarious. It rapidly occupies old clearings, first singly, but then gregariously by coppicing from the stilt-roots. The tree canopy produces a dense leaf-litter which creates a heavy layer of humus. This serves as a nursery for other hardwood species which take over in succession. The tree's rapid growth may be an adverse factor in forest management if left unchecked, but with suitable control practices it could no doubt be used to good effect in regeneration after felling. The tree is sometimes used as a shade plant for coffee plantations. Other Uses The wood is used as a cork substitute. Its extreme lightness lends itself to make fishing-net floats and rafts. Wood-ash from freshly felled trees provides a lye for soap-making. The sap, which tends to be tacky, turns black on exposure to air and is used as ink. The sap from the stilt roots is used to produce a protective film on earthenware pots. Long strong fibres can be extracted from the bark amounting to 25 - 30% by weight. They can be bleached and turned into a resistant paper, or made into twine. The heartwood is white; the sapwood is white and with a slight sheen. The wood is a whitish grey to slightly pink. It is exceptionally light, and is one of the lightest African woods. It is soft, coarse-grained, easily worked though not planing, nor finishing well; strength is poor but it is said that with proper seasoning this can be improved. It is easily split and is used for making palings for enclosing compounds and fields, rough partitions in temporary huts, shingles for interior lining of roofs having an insulating effect. As roof-rafters it is said to last two years. It can be worked into a variety of domestic articles such as stools, musical instruments, walking-sticks, trays, baskets, toy popguns, etc. It has been used to float heavy bridging timbers to inaccessible river-bank sites, and it is recorded that on Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana where canoes or constructed craft are taboo rafts of it are used instead. Larger trunks are used to fashion out canoes and dugouts, long drums and blacksmith’s bellows. The wood is currently recommended in Ghana for use in industrial insulation and in aircraft construction and for models. The wood yields a strong paper and has found recommendation as pulp. The wood is sometimes used as firewood, though it is of low quality. In olden times it provided the fuel for anyone condemned to death by burning."@en .

This is one of the strongest fibres produced in India. The fibre is extracted from shoots less than 12 months old. The outside green skin or bark and a little slimy matter are scraped off, then the ribbons of partly cleaned fibre are stripped from the shoots, the inside of these ribbons is next scraped with a knife so placed in the hand as to allow the edge to rest against the forefinger. The strips are drawn through repeatedly in order to remove the slimy and gummy substances from the inner face. After being cleaned in this way, the ribbons are left to dry in the shade. Wien fully dried they are next steeped in water and wood-ashes for about twenty-four hours, and then boiled in rice water for four hours. The fibre will then be found to be quite free from gum, and may be separated into fine threads. An alternative method, which results in a coarser fibre suited to making ropes, nets etc, is to take off the ribbons when the shoots are in a half-dry state without first scraping off the outer bark and gum. The inner face is also left coated with the slimy substance. The fibre is then purified it in a coarse way by washing it in lime and then twisting it into twine, or simply dividing up the ribbons and without any preparation twisting these into twine."@en .

Nettles are a very valuable addition to the diet, they are a very nutritious food that is easily digested and is high in minerals (especially iron) and vitamins (especially A and C). Only use young leaves (see the notes above on toxicity) and wear stout gloves when harvesting them to prevent being stung. Cooking the leaves, or thoroughly drying them, neutralizes the sting, rendering the leaf safe to eat. The young shoots, harvested in the spring when 15 - 20cm long complete with the underground stem are very nice. Old leaves can be laxative. The plants are harvested commercially for extraction of the chlorophyll, which is used as a green colouring agent (E140) in foods and medicines. A tea is made from the dried leaves, it is warming on a winters day. A bland flavour, it can be added as a tonic to China tea. The juice of the leaves, or a decoction of the herb, can be used as a rennet substitute in curdling plant milks. Nettle beer is brewed from the young shoots."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Nettles have a long history of use in the home as a herbal remedy and nutritious addition to the diet. A tea made from the leaves has traditionally been used as a cleansing tonic and blood purifier so the plant is often used in the treatment of hay fever, arthritis, anaemia etc. The whole plant is antiasthmatic, antidandruff, astringent, depurative, diuretic, galactogogue, haemostatic, hypoglycaemic and a stimulating tonic. An infusion of the plant is very valuable in stemming internal bleeding, it is also used to treat anaemia, excessive menstruation, haemorrhoids, arthritis, rheumatism and skin complaints, especially eczema. Externally, the plant is used to treat skin complaints, arthritic pain, gout, sciatica, neuralgia, haemorrhoids, hair problems etc. The fresh leaves of nettles have been rubbed or beaten onto the skin in the treatment of rheumatism etc. This practice, called urtification, causes intense irritation to the skin as it is stung by the nettles. It is believed that this treatment works in two ways. Firstly, it acts as a counter-irritant, bringing more blood to the area to help remove the toxins that cause rheumatism. Secondly, the formic acid from the nettles is believed to have a beneficial effect upon the rheumatic joints. For medicinal purposes, the plant is best harvested in May or June as it is coming into flower and dried for later use. This species merits further study for possible uses against kidney and urinary system ailments. The juice of the nettle can be used as an antidote to stings from the leaves and an infusion of the fresh leaves is healing and soothing as a lotion for burns. The root has been shown to have a beneficial effect upon enlarged prostate glands. A homeopathic remedy is made from the leaves. It is used in the treatment of rheumatic gout, nettle rash and chickenpox, externally is applied to bruises. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Urtica dioica Stinging Nettle for rheumatic ailments (internal use of leaf), irrigation therapy, for inflammatory disease of the lower urinary tract and prevention of kidney 'gravel' formation, urination difficulty from benign prostatic hyperplasia (root) (see  for critics of commission E)."@en ;

This liquid feed is both insect repellent and a good foliar feed. The growing plant increases the essential oil content of other nearby plants, thus making them more resistant to insect pests. Although many different species of insects feed on nettles, flies are repelled by the plant so a bunch of freshly cut stems has been used as a repellent in food cupboards. The juice of the plant, or a decoction formed by boiling the herb in a strong solution of salt, will curdle milks and thus acts as a rennet substitute.
