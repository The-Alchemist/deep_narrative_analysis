One of the surest of emetics, even moderate doses will induce vomiting until the contents of the stomach have been voided making it especially useful in the treatment of drug overdoses. It is used in a syrup to induce vomiting in children who have ingested toxins. Smaller doses are strongly expectorant and it is a common ingredient in patent cough medicines. The plant needs to be used with caution since excess causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea. The roots are harvested, usually when about 3 years old and the plants are in flower, and are dried for later use. The plants are replanted after partial removal of the roots. The plant is used in homeopathy in the treatment of nausea."@en ;

Its main application is as a diuretic and as a treatment for skin complaints. The leaves, stems and flowering shoots are antispasmodic, astringent, diuretic, foot care, lithontripic and vulnerary. The plant is used as a remedy in gravel, stone or urinary disorders and is believed to be a remedy for epilepsy. A powder made from the fresh plant is used to soothe reddened skin and reduce inflammation whilst the plant is also used as a poultice on cuts, skin infections, slow-healing wounds etc. The plant is harvested as it comes into flower and is dried for later use. Both Asperuloside (a terpenoid) and Coumarin (a benzopyrone) occur in some species of Galium.

The curative properties of the plant parts are ascribed to the presence of medicinally active anthraquinone derivates. The fruit contains rancid smelling capric acid and unpleasant tasting caprylic acid. It is thought that antibiotically active compounds are present. The roots are febrifuge, tonic and antiseptic. They are used to treat stiffness and tetanus and have been proven to combat arterial tension. An infusion of the root is used in treating urinary disorders. The bark is used in a treatment to aid childbirth. Externally, the root is crushed and mixed with oil and is used as a smallpox salve. An infusion of the root bark is used to treat skin diseases. The roots are harvested as required and used in decoctions. The wilted or heated leaf is applied as a poultice to painful swellings in order to bring relief. A poultice of the leaves is applied to wounds or to the head in order to relieve headaches. The crushed leaves, mixed with oil, are applied to the face for the treatment of neuralgia. The leaves are harvested as required during the growing season. The fruits are used as a diuretic, a laxative, an emollient and as an emmenagogue, for treating asthma and other respiratory problems, as a treatment for arthritic and comparable inflammations, in cases of leucorrhoea and sapraemia and for maladies of the inner organs. Liquid pressed from young fruit is snuffed into each nostril to treat bad breath and raspy voice. It is also used in the treatment of mouth ulcers, haemorrhoids, hernia or swollen testicles, headaches, pain caused by barb of poisonous fish, removal of a splinter, childbirth, diabetes, diarrhoea and dysentery, fever, intestinal worms, filariasis, leprosy, and tuberculosis. Young fruits are used to treat high blood pressure. The fruits can be harvested ripe or unripe and are sometimes charred and mixed with salt for medicinal use.

Agroforestry Uses: The plant is a natural pioneer species, rapidly appearing in cultivated ground, after bush fires, deforestation or volcanic activity. It can be used in reforestation projects and, with its wide range of uses, would make a good pioneer species when establishing a woodland garden. It tends to persist, so should only be used within its native range if restoring native woodland. Other Uses A red dye is obtained from the root bark. The basis of the morindone dyeing matter, called Turkish red, is the hydrolysed (red) form of the glycoside morindin. This is the most abundant anthraquinone which is mainly found in the root bark which reaches a concentration of 0.25 - 0.55% in fresh bark in 3 - 5 years. It is similar to that found in Rubia tinctorum. High-yielding bark may be expected after 3 - 5 years. Yield of bark is reported to be 500 - 1,000 kg/ha, containing about 0.25% morindin. Traditionally, Symplocos racemosa (a plant that accumulates aluminium) was used as the mordant to fix the red dye. The fruit pulp can be used to cleanse hair, iron and steel.

Other Uses: The fresh leaves are sometimes used as serviettes or plates. A yellow dye can be obtained from the root bark. The flowers are the source of an essential oil. They are an important raw material in the production of 'attar', which are Indian perfumes with sandalwood (Santalum spp.) base in which one of the essences is absorbed through hydro-distillation.

However, the wood is rated as non-durable, graveyard tests in Indonesia show an average life in contact with the ground of less than 1.5 years. The timber air dries rapidly with little or no degrade. The wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.

  :plant_medicinal_text "The leaves are widely used in Asia and South-East Asia, where they are especially valued for treating digestive problems. Considerable research has been carried out into the medicinal benefits of the plants, with several active compounds having been recorded. Several iridoid glucosides such as asperuloside, scandoside and paederoside have been isolated from the aerial parts of the plant. These glucosides have displayed antitumor activity with paederoside displaying the highest degree of antitumor-promoting activity. Scandoside has been shown to promote the growth of lettuce seedlings. Paederoside showed a similar inhibitory activity to that of asperuloside and daecetyl-asperulosidic acid in a plant growth inhibition test and in an antimicroorganism activity test. The bruised aerial parts of the plant have the fetid odour of indole (methyl-mercaptan). Damage to the tissue releases an enzyme which splits off this sulphur-containing group from paederoside, and is therefore responsible for the unpleasant odour. The most abundant sulphur-containing compound was dimethyl disulphide. The presence of alkaloids and an essential oil have also been recorded. Monoterpenes such as linalol constitute the major components in the oil. In older investigations, decoctions of the plant showed significant anti-inflammatory action against arthritis. The decoction also exhibited marked activity against degenerative osteo-arthritis. The water soluble fraction of the aerial parts displayed anti-inflammatory activity in oedema. It failed to exhibit any analgesic or antipyretic action and showed no ulcerogenic potential. An ethanolic extract of the leaves has shown anticancer activity against human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx. A methanol extract of the leaves has shown hepatoprotective potential, being effective in reversing 6 out of 12 common biochemical (enzymatic) parameters assessed. Another study has shown that the plant has antidiarrhoeal activity, acting by inhibiting intestinal motility - thus supporting its use in traditional medicine. The leaves are anodyne, antirheumatic, antivinous, astringent, carminative, depurative, diuretic, restorative and vermifuge. They are commonly used for the treatment of intestinal complaints such as abdominal pain, colic, cramps, flatulence and dysentery; and are also used for treating rheumatism and gout. The leaves are also used to treat infertility and paralysis. The leaves and stems are also used as a diuretic for inflammation of the urethra. For treating intestinal problems, the fresh leaves are pounded, water added, and the filtered infusion is drunk regularly till convalescence. The plant is considered to have great restorative powers, and the leaves may thus be mixed with food, boiled and eaten - in India, they are often boiled in soup to lessen their smell. Applied externally, the leaves are used to treat swellings and bruises in general, and are mashed then applied for earache, ulcerations of the nose and swollen eyes. They are used as a poultice for treating a swollen belly, distension, herpes or ringworm; and are used in antirheumatic baths. They are applied to the abdomen as a diuretic, and also as a solvent for vesical stones. The juice of the leaves is considered astringent, and is used to treat diarrhoea in children. The bark and the root are considered to be emetic. The juice of the root is prescribed in cases of indigestion, piles, inflammation of the spleen, and pain in the chest and liver. It may help to eliminate poisons collected in the system. In some parts of India, the fruit is used to blacken teeth, and it is also considered a medicine to prevent and treat toothache."@en ;
