It is taken internally in the treatment of lung complaints, dysentery, heart burn and weak stomach. The bark is diuretic. An infusion has been taken to promote urination. A decoction of the bark, mixed with cornmeal, has been used as a poultice to draw out boils. A tea made from the fresh or dried flowers is antispasmodic, diaphoretic and sedative. It is used in the treatment of hypertension, hardening of the arteries, digestive complaints associated with anxiety, feverish colds, respiratory catarrh, migraine etc. Lime flowers are said to develop narcotic properties as they age and so they should only be harvested when freshly opened. An infusion of the leaves has been used as an eyewash. A poultice of the leaves has been used in the treatment of burns and scalds, broken bones and swollen areas. A tea or tincture made from the leaves, flowers and buds has traditionally been used for nervous headaches, restlessness and painful digestion. Use with caution, see notes above on toxicity. A decoction of the roots and the bark has been taken in the treatment of internal haemorrhaging. A decoction of the roots has been used as a vermifuge to rid the body of worms."@en ;

It is then rubbed on a stick to separate the fibres which can then be used for making thread for sewing, fine yarn for weaving bags, clothing etc and cordage for making nets, shoes, twine, mats etc. A fairly wind resistant tree, it can be grown as part of a shelterbelt planting. Wood - soft, straight grained, light, weak, not durable, easily worked, resistant to splitting, it holds nails badly, holds glue, paint and lacquer well, seasons well but shrinks considerably. It weighs 28lb per cubic foot, is odourless and bland-tasting. A commercially important timber in its native range. The white wood is excellent for turning and carving, it is used for making woodenware such as spoons, cheap furniture, pulp etc. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch."@en .

A tea made from the fresh or dried flowers is antispasmodic, diaphoretic, expectorant, hypotensive, laxative and sedative. Lime flower tea is also used internally in the treatment of indigestion, hypertension, hardening of the arteries, hysteria, nervous vomiting or palpitation. The flowers are harvested commercially and often sold in health shops etc. Lime flowers are said to develop narcotic properties as they age and so they should only be harvested when freshly opened. A charcoal made from the wood is used in the treatment of gastric or dyspeptic disturbances and is also made into a powder then applied to burns or sore places."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "A fibre from the inner bark is used to make mats, shoes, baskets, ropes etc. It is also suitable for cloth. It is harvested from trunks that are 15 - 30cm in diameter. The fibre can also be used for making paper. The stems are harvested in spring or summer, the leaves are removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped. The outer bark is removed from the inner bark by peeling or scraping. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye and then beaten in a ball mill. The paper is beige in colour. Wood - soft, white, easily carved. It is very suitable for carving domestic items and small non-durable items. A charcoal made from the wood is used for drawing. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch."@en .
