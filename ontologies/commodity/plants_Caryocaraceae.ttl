  :plant_physical_characteristics "Caryocar Brasiliense is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a slow rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bats, Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."@en ;

  :plant_edible_use :VegetableOil ;
  :plant_edible_text "Edible portion: Fruit, Nut. The oily, mucilaginous fruit is nutritious. A strongly scented, fleshy pulp. It has a sweet flavour, but is an acquired taste and is mainly used as a flavouring or as a famine food. The fruit is eaten fresh or used for sweets and liqueur. The fruit, including the seed, is cooked with rice. A kind of butter and suet are extracted from the fruit. The kernel is rarely eaten because of endocarp spines. The seed has a large number of small spines which can injure the mucous membranes of the mouth. The seeds are the source of an edible oil that is mainly used for flavouring. The high melting point of the oil may give it potential as a cocoa butter substitute"@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The flowers, fruits and seeds are used in local medicine. The bark is diuretic and febrifuge. The fruits are used in the treatment of the common cold and bronchitis. The seed oil, combined with honey, is used in the treatment of the common cold and bronchitis. The leaves contain triterpenes, sterols and ellagic acid."@en ;
  :plant_other_use :VegetableOil ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Low (2/5). Other Uses The oil from the seed is used in the cosmetic industry and locally for making soap, as an illuminant and lubricant. The leaves, bark and fruit pulp are a source of tannin. The wood is moderately heavy, soft, of good natural durability. It is used for engraving, construction, wooden machinery parts, furniture, fences etc. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal. Attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds. Suitable for xeriscaping."@en .

The kidney-shaped kernel is usually well over 5cm long and 2cm in diameter. The seed shell is about 7mm thick and difficult to crack. The large fruit containing the seeds can weigh up to 11kg and measure 18cm in diameter, it contains 1 - 4 seeds (usually 1 or 2) which are easily extracted from it. An edible oil is obtained from the seed. Excellent for preparing bakery products. Fruit - cooked. The oily, yellow pulp is cooked and eaten as a vegetable."@en ;
