The simplest method is to simply split the rhizomes and then rub the pulp on the surfaces to be glued. Alternatively, when the rhizomes are first cooked and then finely grated, they are said to have great tenacity. The water extraction of the plant gives a gum which is separated by precipitation with alcohol. This gum has exceptional strength and lasting power."@en .
