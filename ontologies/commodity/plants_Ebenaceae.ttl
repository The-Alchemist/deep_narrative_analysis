Ebony is a luxurious wood with high decorative and commercial value, it is commonly used for wood carving, furniture, house utensils, interior accessories, and building material. We do not have any more specific information for this species. However, though varying widely in the relative proportion and the colouring of sapwood and heartwood, all the woods of the genus Diospyros are practically indistinguishable as regards their structure, as described below:- Whether or not a given species produces heartwood depends largely on the size the tree has attained, but evidently also on other conditions, as there is a wide variation in the relative amounts of sapwood and heartwood even in individuals of the same species. When produced, the heartwood can be black with rosy, yellowish, brownish, or ashy streaks, sometimes it is nearly or totally black; it is generally sharply demarcated from the thin to very wide band of whitish, yellowish, or red sapwood. The texture is fine, smooth and (especially in the heartwood) very dense; the grain is generally very straight. The wood is hard to very hard; heavy to very heavy; the sapwood is tough and flexible whilst the heartwood is brittle; the heartwood is very durable, the sapwood moderately so. It is difficult to season well, logs almost invariably checking in several directions from the heart outward, while sawn lumber must be stacked carefully and weighted to prevent warping; once thoroughly dried, however, it becomes very stable. Its density makes it difficult to work, but it takes a beautiful surface under sharp tools. Small trees containing little or no heartwood are used locally for posts, beams, joists, rafters, window sills, parts of agricultural implements, etc.; also, in lumbering, small poles are used for skids on account of their hardness, toughness and smooth wearing qualities. The heartwood (or sometimes sap and heart together) is used for scabbards, canes, hilts, tool handles, gunstocks, saw frames, etc.; it is a favorite for musical instruments, especially finger boards and keys of guitars; furniture, cabinetwork, inlaying; paper weights, inkstands and similar desk supplies; the sapwood, which is almost as hard as the heartwood and very much tougher, is an excellent material for T-squares and other drawing instruments, for shuttles, bobbins, spindles, golf-club heads and shafts, axe, pick, and hammer handles, etc."@en .

Leaf-sap is instilled into the eyes for purulent ophthalmia. Examination of the roots on Nigerian material has shown a strong presence of alkaloids."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The heartwood is black, very hard, but appears only in older trees over a certain girth; it is clearly demarcated from the 5 - 12cm wide band of creamy to reddish yellow sapwood that produces bands of black. In Cameroon, where the tree attains a larger stature (25 metres high by 3 - 3.5 m in girth), the heartwood is said to be 95cm girth. The texture is fine; the grain straight or slightly interlocked. The wood is heavy, hard; very durable, being resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. The wood is difficult to saw and work, with serious dulling effect on saws and cutting edges - stellite tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; the surfaces take an excellent polish, but picking up of interlocked or curly grain may occur in planing and a reduced cutting angle is recommended; it has a tendency to split upon nailing, and pre-boring is advised; it has good slicing properties, but powerful machines are needed; the gluing properties are satisfactory. The heartwood is valued for black-wood cabinetry, furniture manufacture and high-class carpentry. It is also used for heavy flooring, interior trim, ship building, vehicle bodies, musical instruments (especially the black keys of pianos, but also guitar fingerboards), precision equipment, turnery, carvings, knife-handles and brush backs. The sapwood, and sometimes also the heartwood, is used for poles, posts, vehicle bodies, agricultural implements, toys, novelties, sporting goods, combs, ladders, boxes, crates, crossbows, veneer and plywood. The wood of young trees is flexible and is used locally to make crossbows. The wood is used for fuel."@en .

The immature fruit can be boiled and used as a vegetable. The fruit is rather boring on its own, but delicious when used in smoothies, jams etc. The dark olive-green fruit is a flattened globose to slightly lobed berry, 5 - 15cm in diameter. The fruit turns a duller colour when ripe and the persistent calyx at the base, which is pressed against the developing fruit, becomes reflexed. At this stage the fruits are still firm.

  :plant_medicinal_text "The plant is widely used in traditional medicine in parts of Africa, and a number of medically active constituents have been isolated. The principle constituent appears to be plumbagin, which has been shown to have antibiotic, antihaemorrhagic and fungistatic properties. It is found in the root-bark to a concentration of 0.9% and but a trace in the leaves. Tannin, saponin and a substance probably identical to scopolamine are also present. There is a high fluoride content. The leaves are astringent, febrifuge, haemostatic, mildly laxative, stimulant and vermifuge. Such reliance is placed on this drug-plant that it is usually prescribed alone. An infusion is used in the treatment of a range of conditions - it is very effective in the treatment of fevers and infectious fevers; and is also used for dysentery; pneumonia; syphilis; leprosy and yaws. A decoction of leafy twigs is taken in draught as a poison-antidote. The leaves and fruit are used internally for treating menorrhoea and dysenteriform diarrhoea. Externally, they are used in the treatment of headaches, arthritis and dermal troubles. The leaves and fruit are chewed or applied as an infusion for treating gingivitis, toothache, as a dressing for cuts and wounds, and to prevent infection. The sap is instilled into the ear for treating otitis. An infusion of the bark is used to treat stomach aches. Applied externally, it is used as a wash on sores, ulcers, etc. Shavings of the wood, combined with the pods of Acacia nilotica and roots of Borassus spp, are pounded in water and boiled for about two hours, after which the liquid is used in Nigeria to rinse the mouth for treating toothache.. Sap from freshly felled trees, as also water from holes in the tree, or an infusion of the black heart-wood, are similarly used"@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Said to be a suitable species for reforestation. Natural regeneration is good. Other Uses: The bark contains a dark-coloured gum which is used to mend broken pottery. The bark is used for dyeing mats red. The fruit-pulp is applied to pottery to glaze and varnish it. The wood is used as chew-sticks. The heartwood is black, very hard, but appears only in older trees over a certain girth; it is clearly demarcated from the 5 - 12cm wide band of creamy to reddish yellow sapwood that produces bands of black. The freshly cut wood is light pinkish-brown, slightly darker to the centre. Blackening of the heart-wood develops only after felling and appears to depend on edaphic characters, trees from savannah situations blackening while those from more thickly forested areas do not. Blackening is possibly a pathological process and burying is said to accelerate it. The texture is fine; the grain straight or slightly interlocked. The wood is heavy, very hard, strong; very durable, being resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. The wood is difficult to saw and work, with serious dulling effect on saws and cutting edges - stellite tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; the surfaces take an excellent polish, but picking up of interlocked or curly grain may occur in planing and a reduced cutting angle is recommended; it has a tendency to split upon nailing, and pre-boring is advised; it has good slicing properties, but powerful machines are needed; the gluing properties are satisfactory. The heartwood is valued for black-wood cabinetry, furniture manufacture and high-class carpentry. It is also used for heavy flooring, interior trim, ship building, vehicle bodies, musical instruments (especially the black keys of pianos, but also guitar fingerboards), precision equipment, turnery, carvings, knife-handles and brush backs. The sapwood, and sometimes also the heartwood, is used for poles, posts, vehicle bodies, agricultural implements, toys, novelties, sporting goods, combs, ladders, boxes, crates, crossbows, veneer and plywood. The wood makes good fuel wood and charcoal."@en .

A beautifully marked heartwood, it is used in high-end applications such as ornamental cabinet work, furniture, carvings, musical instruments. We do not have any more specific information for this species. However, though varying widely in the relative proportion and the colouring of sapwood and heartwood, all the woods of the genus Diospyros are practically indistinguishable as regards their structure, as described below:- Whether or not a given species produces heartwood depends largely on the size the tree has attained, but evidently also on other conditions, as there is a wide variation in the relative amounts of sapwood and heartwood even in individuals of the same species. When produced, the heartwood can be black with rosy, yellowish, brownish, or ashy streaks, sometimes it is nearly or totally black; it is generally sharply demarcated from the thin to very wide band of whitish, yellowish, or red sapwood. The texture is fine, smooth and (especially in the heartwood) very dense; the grain is generally very straight. The wood is hard to very hard; heavy to very heavy; the sapwood is tough and flexible whilst the heartwood is brittle; the heartwood is very durable, the sapwood moderately so. It is difficult to season well, logs almost invariably checking in several directions from the heart outward, while sawn lumber must be stacked carefully and weighted to prevent warping; once thoroughly dried, however, it becomes very stable. Its density makes it difficult to work, but it takes a beautiful surface under sharp tools. Small trees containing little or no heartwood are used locally for posts, beams, joists, rafters, window sills, parts of agricultural implements, etc.; also, in lumbering, small poles are used for skids on account of their hardness, toughness and smooth wearing qualities. The heartwood (or sometimes sap and heart together) is used for scabbards, canes, hilts, tool handles, gunstocks, saw frames, etc.; it is a favorite for musical instruments, especially finger boards and keys of guitars; furniture, cabinetwork, inlaying; paper weights, inkstands and similar desk supplies; the sapwood, which is almost as hard as the heartwood and very much tougher, is an excellent material for T-squares and other drawing instruments, for shuttles, bobbins, spindles, golf-club heads and shafts, axe, pick, and hammer handles, etc."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Because of its tolerance of high arsenic soil levels, this species can be used in the reclamation of gold mine pit wastes. The plant is particularly common on arsenical soils, which are often associated with gold deposits or reefs, and it has been suggested that this species may have value as an indicator of the presence of gold. Other Uses The bark contains tannins and is used to produce fast reddish-brown dyes. The roots are used to dye the various vegetable fibres used in the weaving of mats, baskets etc into various shades of brown and even black when a mordant of iron-rich mud is applied after dyeing. When used for dyeing, the roots are dug up and beaten to bruise the bark. Approximately equal quantities of fresh roots and palm leaves or other fibres are required. The fibres and textiles to be dyed are simply left for some time in the boiling extract and subsequently dried. Depending on how long the fibre to be dyed is left in the boiling dye extract, the colour obtained can range from pale to dark brown or black. The root-bark contains a rich combination of dyeing compounds making this species an interesting fast dye that can be used with or without the addition of metallic salts as mordants, due to the mordanting effect of the tannins present in the plant. Research on the root-bark done in Zimbabwe resulted in the isolation of naphthoquinones and napthoquinone dimers and trimers: 7-methyljuglone (juglone being the main colourant in walnuts, Juglans species), isodiospyrin, and flavonoids which contribute together to the dyeing properties of the plant. The roots are chewed as a disinfectant and to colour the lips and mouth red. The fruits are used as a purple dye for basket fibres by the Kwanyama Ovambos of northern Namibia and also boiled to produce purple ink. The fruits, mixed with those of Berchemia discolour, are crushed and boiled with palm leaf strips and the mixture is allowed to stand for one to several days to produce a purplish-brown dye to decorate baskets. Used alone and without mordant, they give a purple colour that is less fast than the darker colour obtained with the mixture. The roots and twigs are popular as toothbrushes. Some evidence exists that the twigs not only clean the teeth but also inhibit growth of teeth-attacking bacteria because of their high polyphenolic content. The plant is used to purify drinking water. The branches are added to the gourds or pots of water and then left to soak in the water for several hours. This is one of the species used in the treatment of milk to increase its digestibility, palatability and preservation; sometimes treated milk can be stored for over a year without turning bad, which is vital to the household food security. The wood is white with brown spots and is heavy, hard and strong. The sapwood is pinkish to cream-coloured, turning apricot colour on exposure to air. The wood is used for building poles, tool handles, spoons and carving. The wood is used for fuel."@en .
