It has been used in the treatment of upset stomachs, to restore the appetite in children, it is also applied externally as ear and eye drops. A decoction of the roots has been used in the treatment of colds. It has also been used as a treatment for too frequent menstruation. A decoction of the stems, combined with the stems of snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp) is diaphoretic. It has been used to induce sweating in the treatment of fevers, flu etc and also in the treatment of chest pains and lung infections. A decoction of the plant, together with bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata) has been used as a contraceptive. Other recipes involving this plant have also been used as contraceptives including a decoction of the ashes of the plant combined with the ashes of pine branches or buds. A strong decoction of the bark was taken immediately after childbirth to hasten the dropping of the placenta. It was said to help clean out and help heal the woman's insides and also to stop her menstrual periods after the birth, thus acting as a form of birth control."@en ;

It is ready to eat when the flesh has turned brown and is very soft. It will then have a delicious, sweet flavour that reminds you of a lush tropical fruit.

Up to 10mm long and pear shaped, the flesh is sweet but dry and mealy. Another report says that the fruit is up to 20mm in diameter and we have often seen fruits this size, or even a bit larger. We find the fruits of the best forms to have an excellent flavour and juicy texture when fully ripe, but with a hint of bitterness before then. They are one of the later members of this genus to ripen their fruit. The fruit can be used in making pies, preserves, etc, and can also be dried for later use. There are up to five fairly large seeds in the centre of the fruit, these often stick together and so the effect is of eating a cherry-like fruit with a single seed."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Meadowsweet has a very long history of herbal use, it was one of the three most sacred herbs of the Druids. The leaves and flowering stems are alterative, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, diaphoretic, diuretic, stomachic and tonic. The plant is harvested in July when it is in flower and can be dried for later use. The flower head contains salicylic acid, from which the drug aspirin can be synthesised. Unlike the extracted aspirin, which can cause gastric ulceration at high doses, the combination of constituents in meadowsweet act to protect the inner lining of the stomach and intestines whilst still providing the anti-inflammatory benefits of aspirin. The herb is a valuable medicine in the treatment of diarrhoea, indeed it is considered almost specific in the treatment of children's diarrhoea. It is also considered to be a useful stomachic, being used to treat hyperacidity, heartburn, gastritis and peptic ulcers, for which it is one of the most effective plant remedies. It is also frequently used in the treatment of afflictions of the blood. Meadowsweet is also effective against the organisms causing diphtheria, dysentery and pneumonia. This remedy should not be given to people who are hypersensitive to aspirin. A strong decoction of the boiled root is said to be effective, when used externally, in the treatment of sores and ulcers. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh root. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Filipendula ulmaria Meadowsweet for cough, bronchitis, fever and cold (see  for critics of commission E)."@en ;

It is used extensively in Europe for the afforestation of agricultural land and it is also valued for wildlife and amenity plantings. The flowers are a good source of pollen and nectar for bees. This species is a bad companion for potatoes, making them more susceptible to potato blight, it also suppresses the growth of wheat. It also grows badly with plum trees, its roots giving out an antagonistic secretion. Other Uses:  A green dye can be obtained from the leaves. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit. The bark, especially of the root, contains the dye phlorizin. The wood contains the dye xylan.  The seed contains around 30% oil.  The bark usually only contains small amounts of tannin, but this sometimes rises to 16%.  This species has been utilized to breed cherry cultivars with resistance to frost and a number of diseases. Among cultivated forms there are very ornamental ones with double and pink flowers, motley or dissected leaves as well as with a drooping crown.  The heartwood is pinkish-brown; the sapwood red. The grain is fine and straight, with a satiny texture. The wood is firm, compact, and generally free from defects. A valuable, attractive timber that is easy to work, it is used for turnery, furniture, cabinet making, panelling, musical instruments etc. The red sapwood is valued in turnery and woodwork."@en .

The oil contains a large quantity of amygdalin.  The stones are used as well: according to American data, 1,000 tons of stones yields 448 tons of kernels which can yield to 96,235.5 kg (95,563 liters) of syrup, 22,736 liters of spirits, 338,130 liters qf gum, 200 tons of powder, 3 tons of essential oil, and 4.134 tons of fatty oil.  The gum obtained from the stem can be used as an adhesive. It is used in the manufacture of cloth (as a size?).  A green dye can be obtained from the leaves. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit.  The plant can be used as a rootstock for cultivated cherries. The plant is used in breeding programmes for the sweet cherry.  The bark contains 5 - 7% tannins, including some quercetin.  The yellowish red wood is compact, rather heavy. It is suitable for use in woodwork and lathework for making pipes, cigarette holders, hoops for barrels etc."@en .

This has been claimed to have a positive effect in the treatment of cancer, but there does not at present seem to be much evidence to support this. The pure substance is almost harmless, but on hydrolysis it yields hydrocyanic acid, a very rapidly acting poison - it should thus be treated with caution.

This is the size of a large cherry and, when fully ripe, has a reasonable flavour raw with a jelly-like texture and a slight astringency. Some sources suggest the fruit is poisonous, this probably refers to the unripe fruit. We have eaten this fruit in quite large quantities without the slightest ill effects (this also includes a 2 year old child) and so any toxicity is of a very low order. However, any fruit that is bitter should not be eaten in quantity because the bitterness is caused by the presence of the toxic compounds - see the notes above on toxicity. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter and contains one large seed. Water distilled from the leaves is used as an almond flavouring.

Used in small quantities in both traditional and conventional medicine, this exceedingly poisonous compound has been shown to stimulate respiration, improve digestion, and promote a sense of well-being. It is also claimed by some to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer - though this claim has been largely refuted. In larger concentrations, however, cyanide can cause gasping, weakness, excitement, pupil dilation, spasms, convulsions, coma and respiratory failure leading to death. The fruits and flowers of most members of this genus generally have low or very low concentrations of this toxin, though the seeds and young shoots can contain much higher levels.The levels of toxin can be detected by the level of bitterness:- for example sweet tasting almond seeds are a major food crop and are often eaten in quantity, whilst bitter tasting almond seeds are used as a flavouring (in marzipan for example) but are not usually eaten on their own.In general, it can be considered safe to eat any fruit or seed from species in this genus that either have a sweet flavour or are slightly bitter.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is considered to be a dune building species. It has a deep root network that helps to stabilize sand, allowing for the invasion of other plant species and colonization by 'soil building' invertebrates such as ants. It is most abundant on dunes 55 years old or less, and decreases in abundance as dunes age. It has been recommended for revegetation plantings in the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain west along road sides or other bare areas. It is listed as being high in value for restoration of disturbed sites for its soil stabilizing characteristics, and has been recommended for use in the revegetation of coal minespoils in the eastern United States primarily because of its tolerance of acidic soils. Other Uses: A green dye can be obtained from the leaves. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit. Used as a rootstock for the sour cherry. It is a good dwarfing rootstock for peaches, apricots and plums. It produces mostly dwarf trees that are poorly anchored and prone to severe suckering. Compatible with most prunes, it is incompatible with damsons and Victoria plums. Resistant to 'Crown Gall'. Trees on this rootstock are productive and very cold hardy. Cuttings are often easy to root but seedlings vary widely. The plant (especially the var besseyi) has been used to create hybrids with the peach, apricot and plum. The resulting cultivars are generally quite winter hardy and bloom later in the spring which results in less spring freeze damage. Hybrids with the peach are largely sterile, but those with the Japanese plum are highly fertile."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "Rum cherry was widely employed medicinally by various native North American Indian tribes who used it to treat a variety of complaints. It is little, if at all, used in modern herbalism. The bark of the root, trunk and branches is antitussive, astringent, pectoral, sedative, stomachic, tonic. The medicinal properties of this plant are destroyed by boiling, so the plant should only be allowed to steep in warm water. The root bark and the aromatic inner bark have expectorant and mild sedative properties and a tea made from either of them has been used to ease pain in the early stages of labour. The tea is also used in the treatment of fevers, colds, sore throats, diarrhoea etc. The bark is harvested in the autumn and should not be stored for longer than one year since it quickly loses its medicinal properties. Young thin bark is preferred. A decoction of the inner bark has been used in the treatment of laryngitis. The root bark has been used as a wash on old sores and ulcers. The bark contains the glycoside prunasin, which is converted in the digestive tract to the highly toxic hydrocyanic acid. Prunasin is at its highest level in the bark in the autumn so the bark is harvested at this time and can be dried for later use. In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being. The fruit is astringent and has been used in the treatment of dysentery."@en ;

The hedge is stock-proof if it is well maintained, though it is rather bare in the winter and, unless the hedge is rather wide, it is not a very good shelter at this time. Because of its suckering habit, the plant is a natural pioneer species, invading cultivated fields and creating conditions conducive to the regeneration of woodland. Wood - very hard.

It is little, if at all, used in modern herbalism. The roots and the bark are a blood tonic, astringent, pectoral, sedative, tonic and appetite stimulant. An infusion has been used in the treatment of fevers, coughs and colds. An infusion of the root bark has been used as a wash for burns, old sores and ulcers. The inner bark is used externally in the treatment of wounds. A decoction of the inner bark has been used as a treatment for laryngitis and stomach aches. The bark is sometimes used as a flavouring agent in cough syrups. The dried and powdered fruits are used to stimulate the appetite, treat diarrhoea and bloody discharges of the bowels. The astringent unripened fruit has been used by children as a treatment for diarrhoea. The fruit juice has been used as a treatment for sore throats. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being."@en ;

Used in small quantities in both traditional and conventional medicine, this exceedingly poisonous compound has been shown to stimulate respiration, improve digestion, and promote a sense of well-being. It is also claimed by some to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer - though this claim has been largely refuted. In larger concentrations, however, cyanide can cause gasping, weakness, excitement, pupil dilation, spasms, convulsions, coma and respiratory failure leading to death. The fruits and flowers of most members of this genus generally have low or very low concentrations of this toxin, though the seeds and young shoots can contain much higher levels.The levels of toxin can be detected by the level of bitterness:- for example sweet tasting almond seeds are a major food crop and are often eaten in quantity, whilst bitter tasting almond seeds are used as a flavouring (in marzipan for example) but are not usually eaten on their own.In general, it can be considered safe to eat any fruit or seed from species in this genus that either have a sweet flavour or are slightly bitter. Great caution should be taken, however, if the flavour is moderately to very bitter."@en ;

Salmonberry is a pioneer or early seral species noted for its ability to spread aggressively on disturbed sites. A certain amount of soil disturbance is essential for good seedling establishment. Seedlings generally appear in abundance after fire, timber harvest, or other types of disturbance. Rhizomes enable the plant to spread vigorously and form dense patches. In many areas dense stands may form within 2 to 3 years after disturbance. The stands will often diminish as tree species become established and form a canopy, though it can persist almost indefinitely, especially under hardwood canopies such as Alder. Other Uses:  The plant is used in breeding programmes with the raspberry (Rubus idaeus) in North America.  A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit.  The hollowed stems are used as pipes.

A tea made from them is used in the treatment of diarrhoea, as a tonic for the uterus to strengthen pregnant women, and as an aid in childbirth. The tea has also been shown as effective in relieving painful menstrual cramps. The active ingredients both stimulate and relax the uterus. They can be used during the last three months of pregnancy and during childbirth, but should not be used earlier. Externally, the leaves and roots are used as a gargle to treat tonsillitis and mouth inflammations, as a poultice and wash to treat sores, conjunctivitis, minor wounds, burns and varicose ulcers. The leaves are harvested in the summer and dried for later use. The fruit is antiscorbutic and diuretic. Fresh raspberry juice, mixed with a little honey, makes an excellent refrigerant beverage to be taken in the heat of a fever.
