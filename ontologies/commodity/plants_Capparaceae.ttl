  :plant_physical_characteristics "Boscia Senegalensis is an evergreen Shrub growing to 8 m (26ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a medium rate.  It is hardy to zone (UK) 10. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought."@en ;

  :plant_edible_text "Edible portion: Seeds, Leaves, Fruit (Caution), Vegetable. The yellow cherry-sized berries (up to 15mm in diameter) are borne in clusters. When newly ripe, their rather sweet pulp is translucent and jelly-like. However, in the desiccating air it quickly dries out, turning into something not unlike caramel before ending up a brittle, brown, and quite sugary solid. Despite its good taste, this toffee-like treat is difficult to separate from the seed. Besides being eaten fresh, the ripe fruits are often boiled. The juice is sometimes extracted, filtered, and boiled down into a semisolid, which is commonly mixed with millet and curdled milk to make cakes. The dried seeds are used as a substitute for millet or lentils. They require lengthy preparation and must be eaten cooked. The traditional procedure involves soaking the seeds for a week (changing the water daily) to remove bitter components. Less commonly, the seeds are boiled for 3 hours (and rinsed at least twice with new water). In either case, they are subsequently dried and ground into flour and used in making porridge. The roasted seed is used as a substitute for coffee. Young roots, scraped of bark, may be ground, sieved, mixed with cereals, and boiled into a thin gruel or thick porridge. They are very sweet. The roots can be sun-dried and stored for later use. The root tissues are also boiled slowly for several hours to make a sweet syrup. The leaves, although just about the most leathery and least appealing foodstuffs on earth, are also consumed. Most are dropped into soups or boiled and mixed into cereal products such as gruel or couscous. The plant is particularly useful this way because it is an evergreen and provides food and nutrients when other plants are bare. An important food in the Sudan and Mali. The seeds are used as a famine food in emergencies. Chemical composition (after Berry-Koch) (g/mg/mcg per 100g) (dried): Protein = 21g. Fat = 1.6g. Calcium = 123 mg. Fe = 6.8 mg.

  :plant_medicinal_text "The leaves are used as a treatment against bilharziosis, guinea-worm sores, haemorrhoids, intestinal complaints, headaches, colic and ulcers. An emulsion of the leaves is used as an eyewash. The roots are vermifuge. The fruits are used in the treatment of syphilis. The plant (part not specified) is used in the treatment of jaundice and swellings."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Agroforestry Uses: Aizen is a promising plant for establishing famine-food reserves, for protecting erodible soil, for stabilizing dunes, for windbreaks, and for other utilitarian purposes in the harshest of harsh sites. Its foliage is unpalatable to livestock and other herbivores, who only eat it in times of direst need. Thus the trees are able to survive without the need for protection. Other Uses The leaves are added to granaries in order to protect stored foods against pests. This long-standing traditional process seems to work. Leafless twigs contain glucosinalates, which can hydrolyze to mustard oils, which are highly toxic and irritant to mucous membranes. The plant contains natural coagulants. The bark, twigs, leaves, and roots are used to scavenge suspended and colloidal compounds from unclean water (such as that from ponds churned up by storms or from baobab-tree cisterns contaminated with soil). Normally the plant parts are sliced up and placed on the water surface. Compounds leach out and catch the clay and other particulates like magnets, causing them to clump and settle to the bottom. It is reported that truly turbid water can be safely drunk after just a day of such treatment. For even faster results, aizen branches are swirled in the water. Aizen wood is soft and easy to work when boiled. It is cut for poles, notably those holding up houses. Although smoky and stinky, the wood is used as cooking fuel when nothing better is at hand (which in the harshest areas is all too often). This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and birds. Suitable for growing in containers."@en .
