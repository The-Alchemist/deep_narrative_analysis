  :plant_physical_characteristics "Ilex Verticillata is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 1.5 m (5ft) at a slow rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 3.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil."@en ;
