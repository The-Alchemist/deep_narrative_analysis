An edible white, powdery, dry pulp found in the fully ripe fruit is very rich in vitamin C and B2 and makes a refreshing drink. The drink is said to taste like lemonade. Ripe fruits are collected and cracked to remove the 'flour', which is mixed with milk to prepare a flavoured fermented porridge. The pendant fruits are velvet-covered, gray and gourd-like, about 30cm long, and apparently look like dead rats hanging from the tree by their tails. The acid pith of the fruit is used as a substitute for cream of tartar in baking. It is also roasted and used as a coffee substitute. Young leaves - cooked. A tasty spinach. Eaten as a potherb or dried, ground into a powder and used to thicken soups, stews etc. Rich in Vitamin C, they also contain uronic acids - they are in high demand in West Africa as a soup vegetable. An extract of the leaves, called 'lalo', is used to give couscous a smooth consistency. The leaves also form an excellent condiment and seasoning. Seed - eaten mixed with millet meal. Ground into a flour, they are used as a flavouring or baking powder substitute. When slightly fermented, this powder has the flavour of almonds. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute. The seeds contain appreciable quantities of tartaric acid and potassium bitar; they are refreshing to suck, and when soaked in water make a palatable drink. An edible oil can be obtained from the seed. A pleasant flavour. Flowers - raw. Tender roots are eaten. Mature, thick roots are cooked and eaten during times of famine. A root decoction is widely used in Sierra Leone as food. It is prepared by boiling, roasting, soaking or fermenting the roots, and tastes like almonds. The shoots of germinating seeds are edible. Eaten as a vegetable. A delicious flavour. Having a high water content, the wood is chewed by humans and animals in cases of extreme water scarcity. The wood can be used as a salt substitute."@en ;

They are roasted then ground and the powder smeared on the affected part or drunk in water. The seed paste is used for curing tooth and gum diseases. The fruit pulp, seed and bark are reputedly an antidote to Strophanthus poisoning. The pulp is widely used in Africa as a diaphoretic to combat fevers, and to treat dysentery. The gum from the bark is used for cleansing sores. It is also used as an expectorant and a diaphoretic. The bark is used in steam baths for calming shivering and high fever.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Decaying wood of a tree that has died of old age or from lightning is spread on fields as a fertilizer. Ashes from the shell, bark and seed are rich in potash and are useful as a fertilizer. Other Uses Ash from the shell, bark and seed, rich in potash, is widely used in making soap, prepared by boiling the bark and fruit ash in oil. The shell can be used as a dish, water dipper, vessel for liquids, snuffbox, fishing float etc. It also makes an excellent rat trap. The powdered husk or peduncle may be smoked as a tobacco substitute or added to snuff to increase pungency. The pulp extract can be used as a hair wash. The acid pulp is used as a coagulant for rubber. The acid pith is used to coagulate rubber. A glue can be made by mixing flower pollen with water. The wood and bark contains some tannins. The roots produce a useful red dye. A non-drying, golden yellow oil of agreeable taste can be obtained by distilling the seeds. It is used for making soap. The seed contains about 14% oil. The fruit pulp burns with an acrid, irritating smoke that can be used as a fumigant to deter insects troublesome to livestock. The bark is boiled for days to extract a substance poisonous to ants. The bark from the lower part of the stem of younger trees and of the roots can be removed to produce a valuable fibre. The fibres are long, from 90 - 120cm in length. If managed properly the trees are not seriously damaged, and even after repeated use the bark regenerates and can be stripped again some years later. It is used to make excellent cordage, ropes, harness straps, mats, snares and fishing lines, fibre cloth, musical instrument strings tethers, bed-springs and bow strings. The fibres can be woven into waterproof hats that may also serve as drinking vessels. The fibre is the best for making the famous 'kiondo' baskets of Kenya. Strong, tough and tear-resistant paper is produced from the fibre. It is commercially exploited in India for currency notes. The wood is whitish, spongy and light (air-dried 320 kg/cubic m). Easily attacked by fungi, it has no commercial value, but is used locally for making canoes, rafts, insulating boards, wooden platters and trays, boxes and floats for fishing nets. The long-fibred wood is suitable for firewood. The wood is unsuitable for use as a fuel. The shell and seeds are also used for fuel, which potters use to smooth earthenware necklaces before firing."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Very High (5/5). Seaside tree, Public open spaces, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: A large, fast-growing pioneer species, it cannot germinate in the dense forest, requiring light in order to thrive. It can be used in reforestation projects for native woodland, but is probably too large and long-lived for woodland gardens. The tree is an important source of honey and is also suitable for soil erosion control and watershed protection. In agroforestry, it has been grown to supply shade for coffee and cacao, whilst in Java it is used as a support for pepper plants (Piper spp.). Other Uses The fibre from the inner wall of the fruit is unique in that it combines springiness and resilience and is resistant to vermin, to make it ideal for stuffing pillows, mattresses and cushions; it is indispensable in hospitals, since mattresses can be dry sterilized without losing their original quality. It is light (one eighth the weight of cotton), water repellent and buoyant, making it ideal for life jackets, lifeboats and other naval safety apparatus. It is an excellent thermal insulator, being used in iceboxes, refrigerators, cold-storage plants, offices, theatres and aeroplanes. It is also a very good sound absorber and is widely used for acoustic insulation. The seed contains 20-25% non-drying oil, similar to cottonseed oil. It is used as a lubricant, illuminant, in soap manufacturing and in cooking. The main fatty acids are palmitic acid (10 - 16%), stearic acid (2 - 9%), oleic acid (49 - 53%) and linoleic acid (26 - 29%). The ash of the wood is rich in potash and can be used in making soap. The bark is used for making hut walls and doors. A gum and a reddish brown dye are obtained from the bark. The heartwood is variable in colour, from creamy white to light brown, often with greyish veins, but sap-staining fungi may darken it; it is not clearly demarcated from the sapwood. The grain is interlocked, sometimes irregular; the texture coarse; growth rings are prominent; the silica content is low. The wood is soft, weak and very light in weight; it is extremely vulnerable to decay when in contact with the soil and is also susceptible to termites. Both logs and lumber are very susceptible to insect and fungal attack, but preservation treatment is easy. The wood seasons normally, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is poorly to moderately stable in service. It machines easily but not satisfactorily, leaving surfaces fuzzy - tools should be kept very sharp; nailing and screwing are poor; gluing is correct. The wood is easy to peel for veneer. A low quality timber, the reported uses of the wood include for plywood, packaging, lumber core stock, light construction, boxes and crates, cheap furniture, matches, pulp and paper products. Traditionally, it is used for canoes, rafts and farm implements. Although it has been recorded to be used for fuel, it is not considered very suitable for this purpose because it only smoulders."@en .

The bark is a rich source of tannins and antioxidant chemicals called proanthocyanidins. One in particular, procyanidin B-2, has been shown in various studies to help promote hair growth and alleviate baldness. Other independent research indicates that procyanidin B-2 also has antitumor and anticancer effects (even against melanoma) as well as lowers blood pressure and protects the kidneys. The bark also contains a chemical called kaurenoic acid which has been documented with antibacterial and antifungal properties in many studies over the years. The leaves of mutamba contain caffeine, however none has been found in the bark of the tree. Other studies have shown that the plant lowers heart rate and blood pressure, relaxes smooth muscles and stimulates the uterus. Various studies using leaf and bark extracts have clinically demonstrated remarkable antibacterial activity against several disease-causing pathogens, including Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, E. coli, and Neisseria gonorrhea. One of the recent 2003 studies also confirmed its antioxidant effects. In a 1995 in vitro study, mutamba also demonstrated antiviral activity. The bark is the part most used. It is used as to induce perspiration, as a tonic and a blood cleanser, and is employed to treat a wide range of disorders including; digestive tract problems such as gastrointestinal pain, liver problems, diarrhoea and dysentery; urinary and reproductive tract problems such as kidney problems, uterine pain, prostate problems, venereal disease and as an aid to childbirth; respiratory tract problems such as asthma, bronchitis, coughs and pneumonia; fevers and haemorrhages. Applied externally, it is used to bathe wounds, rashes and sores; to treat skin problems, including dermatosis, elephantiasis and leprosy; it is applied to the scalp to arrest hair loss and combat parasites of the scalp. The fruit (in Mauritius), the roasted seeds (in Java), and the bark (in India) are officinal remedies against elephantiasis). An infusion of the crushed, seed soaked in water, is used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, colds, coughs and venereal diseases. It is also used as a diuretic and astringent."@en ;

Other Uses The tough, fibrous bark and young stems are used to make rope and twine. The mucilaginous sap is used sometimes in sugar fabrication to clarify syrup. The heartwood is pinkish to brownish; it is not clearly demarcated from the light brown sapwood. The texture is coarse; the grain is straight to interlocked; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive taste or aroma. The fibrous wood is light in weight; it is not durable, being very susceptible to attack by dry-wood termites. It is easy to work and finishes well. It is used for posts, interior carpentry, light construction, furniture, boxes and crates, shoe horns, tool handles etc. The tree can be used for fuel and to make charcoal.

In other parts of its range the bark is a component of arrow poisons too. In processing, the wood produces high levels of dust which can cause serious health problems to workers. The dust may cause dermatitis, nose-bleeding, throat irritation, asthma and eczema, the reactions becoming stronger on repeated exposure. Heart troubles have also been reported. Pigs given the sawdust as litter developed severe contact dermatitis and piglets even died. The toxins in the wood, even in the form of thin veneer, are resistant to oxidation and are heat-stable; they remain effective for many years. Ethanol and chloroform extracts of the bark have shown a very strong toxicity against several mammals."@en ;

An ethanolic extract of the wood has shown hepatotoxic and haematotoxic effects when administered orally. Extracts of the bark have been shown to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Because of its antibacterial properties, the addition of small amounts of bark to the diets of chicken, as a substitute of commercial antibiotics, improved feed conversion rates. The bark contains the highly toxic compound mansonine, related to cardenolides from Digitalis and ouabain from Strophanthus. Its aglycon was identified as strophanthidin. In addition some 30 toxic glycosides have been identified. From the wood similar glycosides, an azulene derivative, and a range of quinones, called mansonones A-I and L, have been isolated. Mansonone A is the main causal agent of the allergic reaction to the sawdust. The seeds too contain a large number of cardenolide glycosides, including glycosides of strophanthidin and nigrescigenin. The glycosides strophothevoside and strophalloside are about as toxic to mammals as ouabain."@en ;

The wood is easy to work with hand and machine tools with little or only moderate blunting effect on cutting edges and no charring; the surface can be worked to a good finish; the wood holds nails and screws fairly well, but iron tends to corrode in contact with it; gluing properties are good; the wood takes stain and polish well. The wood peels well, but requires softening beforehand; veneer is rather fragile. Steam-bending is easy unless knots are present. The wood is used for general and high-class joinery, cabinet work, furniture, turnery, decorative veneer and handicrafts. It is also used in construction for doors and windows, in railway coaches and shop fittings, and for boxes and crates.

Other Uses The woolly fibre contained in the seedpods has sometimes been used like kapok as a stuffing material in pillows and mattresses. The fibre obtained from the bark has been used to make ropes. The heartwood is white to grey-white, sometimes with a pinkish tinge near the heart in older trees; it is not demarcated from the sapwood. The grain is straight; texture coarse and even; the lustre silky. The heartwood is too heavy to be of economic importance and most of the commercially used stock is sapwood. The wood is extremely light in weight - it is the lightest known commercial timber, being even lighter than cork. High-grade timber weighs less than 150 kg/m_ at 12% moisture content and is generally produced by young trees 8 - 9 years old, whereas older trees produce heartwood, which is heavier and is considered of secondary quality. Large differences exist between the outermost sapwood and that from nearer the centre - the new wood in the outer 3cm being on average 2.2 times heavier than the old wood in the inner 3cm. The wood is very soft and weak, but with a good strength to weight ratio, and that from old trees tends to be brittle. It is non-durable and prone to attack by Anobium and Lyctus borers, termites and longhorn beetles. The rates of shrinkage from green to oven dry are small to medium, kiln drying is preferable to air drying, to minimize splitting and warping. Movement in service is small. The wood is very easy to work with hand and machine tools, but sharp tools are needed to prevent crumbling. It takes nails and screws readily, but is too soft to hold them well. Planing is almost impossible; gluing properties are good, and the wood stains, polishes and paints satisfactorily, but it is very absorbent. Bending properties are poor. Balsa possesses an unusually high degree of buoyancy and is a very efficient insulation against heat and sound, it can be used at very low temperatures (down to -250?c). Some older trees develop a pink heartwood that tends to be brittle and is much inferior to the sapwood. The wood is suitable for pulping by chemical and semi-chemical processes, yielding 45 - 50% pulp with good strength characteristics. The pulp can be easily bleached without loss of strength, making it suitable for printing and writing papers. The extremely lightweight wood is used for floats, buoys, lifejackets and life-belts, surf boards, aircraft construction, ship and boat building, lightweight boxes, toys, model making, laboratory mounting boards, core stock in sandwich construction, surgical splints, packaging of fragile articles and as insulation for temperature, vibration, sound and formerly also for electricity. Slightly heavier wood is suitable for matches, popsicle sticks and toothpicks, and for the production of pulp and paper."@en .

Other Uses The bark fibres can be used for cordage. It is used to manufacture a good quality rope which is can be used for caulking boats and is also used for plaiting mats. The green bark peels off easily in wide strips. It is used for making a fine fibre and is also beaten out to make traditional tapa bark cloth. Tapa cloth is produced by beating strips of bark on a flat surface with a wooden mallet. A very fine cloth can be made in this way, the more the bark is beaten the finer the cloth becomes. Larger sizes can be made by overlapping 2 pieces of bark and beating them together. The fibre from the bark has a wide range of other applications, including being used as canoe caulking; to make cordage for clothing and dancing skirts and kilts; coconut-climbing bandages or foot harnesses; mats; sandals; sewing tape; paint brushes; slings; kava strainers. The wood, when dried for six months, is used for fireworks. The heartwood is a dark greenish brown; the sapwood whitish. The wood is light in weight, moderately soft and porous. The wood is useful for light construction, net floats and corks. An important wood for the Polynesians, who use it for a wide range of purposes, including the outriggers of canoes, carving, house rafters, pig-tethering posts, spreaders, bailers, booms and occasionally hulls, fishing rods, hoists and floats, fishnet frames and handles, bows, fruit-picking rods, tools etc. The wood is used for fuel. It makes a decent firewood, especially for slow smoking, and is used in making fire by friction. Paper manufactured from H. Tiliaceus pulp is of low quality as the fibres are short (0.7-1.3 mm) and is only suitable for wrapping paper."@en .

These are widely used in the confectionery industry to made chocolate confections, cakes, ice cream, drinks etc. The somewhat bitter flavour is usually moderated by adding sugar or other sweeteners. The seed contains up to 50% fat. The ripe seeds are cured by pressing, fermenting and then drying them. The cured seeds are then roasted and ground into a powder to make cocoa. A butter-like fat (called cocoa butter) is extracted from the seeds. The fruit contains about 20 - 40 seeds surrounded by a thin, succulent pulp with a slightly sweet flavour. This pulp is sucked as a sweet snack. It can be made into juices and jellies. The seed contains a pigment that is said to be useful as a food colouring."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Although used mainly as a food, cacao does also have some therapeutic value. The seed contains a range of medically active constituents including xanthines, a fixed oil and endorphins. It is a bitter, stimulant, diuretic herb that stimulates the nervous system, lowers blood pressure and dilates the coronary arteries. Cacao powder and butter are nutritive, the latter also soothes and softens damaged skin. The seed is used in central America and the Caribbean as a heart and kidney tonic. An infusion of the baked seed-membranes is drunk as a remedy for anaemia. Combined with the stems of Chromolaena odorata and the wood of Cecropia obtusa, the seed is applied externally as an emollient in a remedy to extract splinters or prickles embedded in the skin. Cacao powder is taken internally in the treatment of angina and high blood pressure. The rural people in Amazonas State, Brazil, rub cocoa butter on bruises. It is often used to treat chapped skin and burns. Research has shown that it can help to counter the bacteria responsible for boils and septicaemia. The leaf contains genistic acid. This has been shown to be antirheumatic and analgesic. An infusion of the leaf buds is used with incense to treat diarrhoea. An infusion of the dry pods is used to decrease leprosy spots."@en ;

Other Uses The cacao tree provides a wide range of commodities for local peoples including fibre for cloth, thread and paper; wood for construction, making implements etc; coverings for their houses and many other items. The ash from pod husks contains potassium oxide, which can be extracted in the form of potassium hydroxide, a useful alkaline in the saponification process. The burnt husks can be pounded and made into a paste that has a soapy residue and can be used for washing clothes. Cocoa-bean fat from unfermented cocoa beans can be extracted and used in soap making. Cacao butter, obtained from the seeds, is used in skin creams, cosmetics and as a suppository base. The wood is light, soft and of low durability. Of little value, it is sometimes used for fuel or to make charcoal. The cocoa bean testa is used for fuel. It has a calorific value of 16 000-19 000 BTU/kg, a little higher than that for wood."@en .

In Nigeria Triplochiton scleroxylon is planted in agroforestry systems with cocoa. The plant is a natural pioneer species, rapidly invading open land in situations such as abandoned farm land. It could be used to help re-establish native forest or as a nurse tree in establishing a woodland garden. Other Uses The bark is used to cover the roof and walls of huts. The heartwood is whitish to pale yellow; it is indistinctly demarcated from the up to 15cm wide band of somewhat lighter sapwood. The grain is usually interlocked, sometimes straight; texture is moderately coarse. The wood has a ribbon-like aspect on quarter-sawn faces, and is lustrous. Fresh wood has an unpleasant smell, which disappears upon drying. The wood is very light in weight; very soft; not durable, being liable to fungal attack (e.g. blue stain), and susceptible to termites, powder-post beetles and dry-wood borers - it should not be used in contact with the ground or exposed to the weather. It seasons rapidly with little risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable to stable in service. It works easily with hand and machine tools; ordinary saw teeth and cutting tools can be used; sharp edges are needed for a smooth finish, and the wood tends to tear in mortising - a cutting angle of 15? is recommended when planing to prevent tearing; peeling and slicing properties are good; the wood stains and polishes well; filling is recommended to obtain a good finish; nailing and screwing properties are rather poor; splitting may occur; gluing does not cause problems, although it must be done carefully as the wood is absorbent. The carving characteristics are good. The wood is widely used for interior joinery, panelling, moulding, furniture, boxes and crates, sculptures, matches, pencils, peeled and sliced veneer for interior and exterior parts of plywood, fibre and particle boards, and block board. It is of great importance for house building, for beams, posts and planks, and is also used for roof shingles. The wood from the buttresses is used to make doors, platters, bowls and sandals, and the bole is used for dugout canoes. The wood pulp can be used to produce paper of moderate quality."@en .
