In Chinese medicine it is used as a warming herb to treat stomach chills, food poisoning, cholera, dysentery, diarrhoea and vomiting caused by cold. It is used externally in Ayurvedic medicine to treat nasal congestion, sinusitis, epilepsy and skin inflammations. The essential oil is antiseptic, antibacterial and febrifuge.
