The shell is very hard, making it difficult to extract the seed. The seed is up to 3cm long and wide.  An edible oil can be obtained from the seed, though it is seldom extracted due to the high value of the seed. The seed contains the highest level of oil yet found in a nut - up to 75%. The oil contains 80% monounsaturated fats and 8% omega-6 fatty acids. It has a subtle, nutty flavour and is added to salads, used in cooking etc."@en ;
