  :plant_physical_characteristics "Ailanthus Altissima is a deciduous Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a fast rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 7.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought. The plant is not wind tolerant. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "The tree of heaven is not often used in Western herbal medicine, though it is more popular in the Orient. Various parts of the plant are used, though the bark is the part most commonly used - however, it contains a glycoside that has not been fully researched and so should be used with caution. The root and stem bark are antispasmodic, astringent, bitter, cardiac depressant, diuretic, emetic, febrifuge, rubefacient and vermifuge. The vermifuge properties do not act on round worms or earthworms. A nauseatingly bitter herb, it is used internally to treat malaria and fevers, it also slows the heart rate and relaxes spasms. It needs to be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner since the bark readily causes vomiting. In China, the bark is a popular remedy for dysentery and other complaints of the bowels. In one clinical trial, 81 out of 82 patients were cured of dysentery when they were given this herb. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in the treatment of cardiac palpitations, asthma and epilepsy. Tree-of-heaven is a folk remedy for asthma, cancer, diarrhoea, dysentery, dysmenorrhoea, dysuria, ejaculation (premature), epilepsy, eruption, fever, gonorrhoea, haematochezia, leucorrhoea, malaria, metrorrhagia, sores, spasms, spermatorrhoea, stomachic, tumours of the breast (China), and wet dreams The bark is harvested in the spring and dried for later use. The leaves, bark of the trunk, and roots are put into a wash to treat parasitic ulcers, itch, and eruptions. In Korea, the root bark is used in the treatment of coughs, gastric and intestinal upsets. The stembark is emmenagogue. The leaves are anthelmintic, astringent and deobstruent. The fruit is used in the treatment of bloody stools and dysentery. They have also been used to treat ophthalmic diseases. Extracts from the plant are bactericidal. The tree is used in homeopathic remedies for cancer. A resin extracted from the roots and leaves is a revulsive or vesicant."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "A yellow dye is obtained from the leaves. The leaves contain 12% tannin, quercetin, as well as isoquercetin, and the alkaloid linuthine. The leaves and wood are high in cellulose and are used in paper-making. The crushed leaves and flowers are insect-repellent. The plant parts, when steeped in water, are said to yield an insecticidal solution. An aqueous extract of the leaves contains a substance that is toxic to other tree seedlings. When plants are put into marshy areas they drain the soil and thereby remove mosquito breeding sites. The plants have extensive root systems and sucker freely, they can be used in soil-stabilization programmes. Since the plant is tolerant of soil pollution it can also be used in land reclamation schemes on old mine tips etc. Plants can be grown as a tall hedge. Wood - fairly hard, heavy, difficult to split, not durable, coarse grained. Though little used, except in poorer countries, the wood is suitable for cabinetry, cellulose manufacture, furniture, lumber, pulp, and woodwork. It is difficult to split but easy to work and polish. The wood is also used locally for charcoal and firewood. Yields of 20 cubic metres per hectare is possible for this light wood."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "As its name suggests, the plant is of value in traditional medicine for the treatment of dysentery. Modern research has confirmed this action and also highlighted other potential uses of the plant. The leaves and stem bark contain quanninoids and canthin alkaloids that have potent anticancer properties, and these have attracted much research attention in recent decades. Some trials have been inconclusive, whilst others have shown promising results, especially since the effects were facilitated in the absence of overt toxicity. In addition to their antineoplastic activity, many compounds present in the plant are highly effective against the dysentery-causing amoeba, Entamoeba histolytica, and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Quassinoids from the plant have exhibited weak anti-tuberculosis activity in vitro, whilst their anti-HIV potential is marred by high cytotoxicity. Quassinoids are characteristic of the Simaroubaceae; they give the bark of Brucea antidysenterica a distinctive bitter taste. Canthin alkaloids, present in the root bark of Brucea antidysenterica, have anticancer and antimicrobial properties. The bark, fruit and roots are widely used against dysentery, as an anthelmintic and to treat fever. The bark, fruit, seeds, leaves and roots (sometimes boiled) are used as a remedy for diarrhoea, indigestion and stomach-ache. The leaves and roots are cooked with meat, or infused with milk (for children) to relieve asthma. Wounds and skin complaints, such as those caused by leprosy and scrofula, are treated with ointments made from the leaves and twigs mixed with ghee or butter, or from the ripe fruits mixed with honey. Preparations of the roots are used on sores caused by sexually transmitted diseases, while the leaves and seeds are used to treat cancerous skin tumours. The roots are used to treat rabies."@en ;

It is an intensely bitter, non-astringent, odourless herb that lowers fever, stimulates appetite and improves digestion. It is an effective parasiticide and is reputedly antileukaemic. Some of the quassinoids have been shown to have cytotoxic and antileukaemic actions. The strongly bitter principle in the bark supports and strengthens weak digestive systems, increasing bile flow plus the secretion of salivary juices and stomach acids. It is used internally in the treatment of a wide range of illnesses where digestion is a contributory factor, particularly convalescent debility, poor appetite and anorexia. Its bitterness has led to it being used in the treatment of malaria and other fevers. It is also used to rid the body of nematode worms. Used externally, it is a good lotion to get rid of parasites such as lice. It is also used in an enema to rid the body of threadworms and other parasites. The bark can be harvested as required throughout the year, and can be dried for later use."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "All parts of the plant contain a bitter principle called quassimarin. This has a range of medical properties including antileukaemic, antitumor, astringent, digestive, febrifuge, laxative, tonic and vermifuge. Quassimarin has been shown to stimulate the secretion of gastric juices, increase the appetite and aid digestion. It has been used successfully in the treatment of anorexia nervosa and is also used in the treatment of malaria and fevers. All parts of the plant can be used on their own or in combination to restore the appetite, stimulate digestion and combat fevers, including malaria. A tea made from the infused leaves is used to bathe the skin of measles patients. It is also used as a mouthwash after tooth extractions. A decoction of the bark is used as a blood purifier and to treat malaria, diarrhoea and dysentery. A decoction of the inner bark is used to treat colds. The bark is used for treating the weak eyes of alcoholics and, macerated in rum, as a vermifuge. Combined with the macerated stem of Tinospora crispa in rum, cognac or absinthe, it is used to make a beverage for treating diabetes and albuminuria. A decoction of the wood is used in lotions as a wash for persistent venereal ulcers. A decoction of the bark and leaves is used as a wash to rid the skin of external parasites such as agouti lice and as a treatment for measles and smallpox. Stem-bark contains the insecticidal compounds neoquassine and quassine. Sap shows activity against cells derived from carcinoma of human nasopharynx.

They are also used as a digestive, emmenagogue and to treat parasites both within and on the body. Research has discovered a range of medically active compounds in the plant. The main active compounds are a group of triterpenes called quassinoids. The antiprotozoal and antimalarial properties of these chemicals have been documented for many years. Several of the quassinoids found in simarouba, such as ailanthinone, glaucarubinone, and holacanthone, are considered the plant's main therapeutic constituents and are the ones documented to be antiprotozoal, anti-amoebic, antimalarial, and even toxic to cancer and leukaemia cells. Studies have shown that the plant is over 90% effective against amoebic dysentery The bark, and/or its three main quassinoids, have been shown to be an effective treatment against malaria, including strains that have become resistant to drug treatment. Research has also shown that the bark has good antiviral properties, effective against herpes, influenza, polio, and vaccinia viruses. The quassinoids responsible for the anti-amoebic and antimalarial properties have also been shown to possess active cancer-killing properties. The bark is used as a bitter tonic. It is known as 'Jamaica Bark' or 'Orinoco Simaruba Oil'. A decoction is taken internally in the treatment of anaemia, diarrhoea, dysentery, malaria, fevers, haemorrhages, intestinal parasites and colitis. The leaves are used in the treatment of rheumatism, or are applied in the form of a lotion for body pain, bruises or skin itch.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing tree that tolerates full sun; provides food for the native fauna; supplies a range of commodities for humans; and has various soil improving actions - it is an excellent choice as part of a mixed planting when restoring native woodland and also for establishing woodland gardens. The tree has a well-developed root system and an evergreen, dense canopy - it efficiently checks soil erosion, supports soil microbial life, and improves groundwater availability. It is shade tolerant and occurs as an under-storey tree, particularly under the canopy of large fruit trees where birds perch and deposit the seeds. It is found as an associated species of the subtropical moist forest, sharing a position with other common trees of the home and humid perennial gardens, such as mango (Mangifera indica), royal palm (Roystonea borinquena), avocado (Persea americana) and plantain (Musa x paridisiaca). The oilcake being rich in nitrogen (8%), phosphorus (1.1%) and potash (1.2%), is good organic manure. The pulp and leaf litter can be economically used in the manufacture of vermicompost (about 8 tons/ha/year). Other Uses An oil obtained from the seed can be used for industrial purposes in the manufacture of bio-fuels, soaps, detergents, lubricants, varnishes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals etc. The seed shells can be used in the manufacture of particleboard, activated charcoal or as fuel. Freshly cut, the heartwood is whitish or cream coloured with occasionally a yellow or greenish cast - when dry it becomes a uniform cream colour with occasional oily streaks; it is not differentiated from the sapwood. The texture is medium to coarse, and uniform; the grain usually straight; lustre is rather high; there is no odour but there is a bitter quinine-like taste. The wood is very light in weight; very soft; not very strong; somewhat brittle; not durable outdoors and is very susceptible to dry-wood termite attack and prone to blue stain. It seasons rapidly, with little chance of distortion or checking; once dry it is stable in service. It works easily and machines to a smooth clean surface; it is easy to finish, though filling is recommended in order to obtain a good surface; nailing and screwing are poor; gluing is correct. The wood is used as the sounding board for string instruments, for interior construction, turnery, boxes and crates, matches, furniture components, veneer and plywood, pattern making, millwork, particleboard and fibreboard."@en .
