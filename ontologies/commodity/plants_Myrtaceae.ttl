This species is a very rich source of citronella, which is much used in the perfumery industry. Some batches of the essential oil contain 98% citronella. Glabrous leaves may contain oil with 65.5% citronellal, 12.2% citronella, and 3.6% isopulegol; hairy leaves contain more oil with 86.6- 90.1% citronellal, 4.6 - 6.0% citronella, and 0.7 - 0.8% isopulegol, 1-pinene, b-pinene, and isovaleric aldehyde are also recovered. The leaves and the essential oil are used as an insect repellent. The leaves are also an ingredient of potpourri. The bark may contain up to 12% tannin. The heartwood is pale grey-brown to dark brown; it is demarcated from the up to 60mm wide band of white or cream sapwood. The grain is straight or interlocked and occasionally wavy; the texture open and coarse. The wood is hard, strong and tough. It saws easily, planes well, but is rather difficult to nail and prone to checking and collapsing during drying. The timber is susceptible to marine borer and termite attack It is used for general and heavy construction such as frame and bridge construction, flooring, cladding, tool handles and case manufacturing. The wood is used for fuel. The hard heavy wood (sp. grav. 0.75 - 1.1) burns steadily and makes a good charcoal with an ash content of 1 - 2%.

The bark contains 2.5 - 16% tannin, the wood 2 - 14%, and the kino 46.2 - 76.7%. A fast growing tree with wide-ranging roots, it can be planted in soil stabilization schemes and can also be planted in marshy land where it will help in draining the land, thereby destroying a potential breeding site for mosquitoes. It is planted in S. Italy for this purpose. The wood, durable, easy to saw, yet resistant to termites, is widely used in Australia for strong durable construction, interior finish, flooring, cabinetry, furniture, fence posts, cross-ties, sometimes pulpwood. Australian aborigines made canoes from the bark. According to NAS (1980a), annual wood yields are around 20 - 25 m3/ha in Argentina, 30 m3 from Israel, 17 - 20 from Turkey in the first rotation, and 25 - 30 in subsequent coppice rotations.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The tree is planted in windbreaks. Soya beans (Glycine max), interplanted with this tree as part of an agroforestry research project in southeastern Brazil, suppressed weeds without adversely affecting tree survival and growth. Maize and sorghum have also been found compatible to grow with this plant. When planted adjacent to avocado orchards, it reduces the yields by shading and competing unfavourably with the avocados for light, nutrients and water. Other Uses: The leaves yield 0.3 - 4.7% essential oil, containing alpha-pinene (30.4 - 68.9%), beta-pinene (0.4 - 6.6%), p-cymene (up to 16.1%), terpinen-4-ol (up to 10.7%), 1,8-cineole (up to 4.8%), alpha-terpineol (0..5 - 8.0%), limonene (2.4 - 5.6%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (up to 9.4%). The essential oil has shown larvicidal activity against the mosquito Aedes aegypti, with alpha-pinene being the principal larvicidal component. The colour of the heartwood ranges from almost white to pink or dark red; it is clearly demarcated from the 2 - 5cm wide band of paler sapwood. The grain is straight or interlocked; the texture medium to coarse; gum veins are common. The wood is moderately strong, moderately heavy and soft, being softer and lighter than that of many other eucalypts. It is moderately durable at best, being resistant to dry wood borers, somewhat resistant to fungi and susceptible to termites - untreated wood is not suitable for use in contact with the ground. The sapwood is generally resistant to Lyctus borers. It is somewhat difficult to dry, but checking can be avoided by careful control of the conditions during the early stages of drying. The wood is usually not very stable in service. The wood works well with machine and hand tools, but the surface may be woolly and the wood has a tendency to splinter. It saws cleanly, planes excellently and takes all kinds of finish well. Nail and screw holding properties are good, but the wood tends to split on nailing unless pre-bored. The gluing properties are good. The wood has been used for fence posts, building, transmission and telephone poles, boxes and hooks. It is especially used for boat building, flooring, plywood, panelling and general construction. It can also be used for sawn timber but has tendency to split. It has been used as a source of pulp for making paper. Large quantities of the wood are used for charcoal, for iron smelting, for example in Brazil. The firewood is used for domestic purposes and for curing tobacco. The wood has an energy value of 18,100 - 19,400 kJ/kg."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The tree is used in reforestation schemes and is also sometimes planted to stabilize dunes. It is suitable for planting in coastal areas as shelterbelts. Although intolerant of salt spray, it is quite wind firm. It is often used as a windbreak, even though the trees often become deformed by continuous exposure to wind. Because of their rapid growth, Eucalyptus species use a relatively large amount of water and can be used as pumps to lower the water table and help dry wet sites. This species has been used very successfully in to dry swampy ground, making it possible to grow less flood-tolerant species on the same site. Other Uses: The gum in the trunk contains about 30% tannin. The bark contains over 8% tannins. The dried leaves yield up to 41% tannin. The essential oil yield from the leaves is 1.7%, with the characteristic constituents being piperitone, rho-cymene, linalool, 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, citronellyl acetate and alpha-terpinol. The heartwood is pale red when freshly cut, turning orange-red or red-brown with age; it is clearly demarcated from the up to 5cm wide band of pale brown sapwood. The grain is interlocked, texture coarse. Quartersawn surfaces sometimes have a ribbon figure of light and dark stripes. The wood is fairly heavy, moderately hard, strong, durable and able to be used in moist conditions, resistant to attacks by fungi and most insects, including marine borers, and moderately resistant to termite attack. The high shrinkage, coupled with the interlocked grain, means the wood requires careful drying. During drying distortion and splitting may occur; serious degrade can be avoided by air drying to a moisture content below 30% before kiln drying. The wood is not stable in service. The wood works well and takes a good polish. It is somewhat abrasive, and planing may be affected by interlocked grain. Therefore, slow speeds and a cutting angle of 20? are recommended. Sawing and working properties are generally good, although gummy exudates may clog up saws. The wood holds nails well, but pre-boring is necessary to avoid splitting. It turns well, and paints and waxes satisfactorily. Gluing is fairly difficult. The wood is not suitable for steam-bending. It is used for general construction and for poles, fencing, and wharf and bridge work. Other uses include pallets, house siding, flooring, ordinary furniture, interior trim, and panelling. Because of its strength and durability, it is also commonly used for mine props, railway sleepers, fence posts, stakes and gates. The stakes last a long time in the ground and can be driven repeatedly without splitting. The timber is also used for pulpwood, but the pulp is dark reddish-brown and is not as good for this purpose as some other species of Eucalyptus. The wood makes an excellent fuel and is good for making charcoal. It has an energy value of 19,600 - 20,500 kJ/kg."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Planted in shelter-belts as a windbreak and for shade. It is a suitable species for reforestation programmes. The trees are also used in the restoration and immobilization of dunes, to control erosion by wind, and as hedges. They can be planted along the banks of rivers to stabilize the soil. The tree is a major source of pollen and nectar, producing a caramel-flavoured honey. Other Uses The wood contains 6 - 12% tannin, and the bark 3 - 15%. The leaves are one of the sources of the essential oil 'eucalypt oil', and the principal component of the oil in the leaf is cineole (45%). The oil yield percentage by fresh weight is 0.9 - 1.4%. The leaves yield 0.45 - 3.4% essential oil. The essential oil has shown insecticidal activity. The wood contains 0.5% essential oil. Kino (a red substance resembling resin) is obtained from the tree. The general colour is brown, and it can readily be reduced to a fairly fine powder between the fingers. It forms a light reddish-brown turbid liquid, leaving a muddy-looking residue of a salmon colour, evidently composed of finely divided particles of resin, wood, and a gelatinous substance. Rich in tannins, it can be used medicinally and for tanning. The heartwood is pale to dark red,and fairly well demarcated from the grey to cream-coloured sapwood. The grain is wavy or interlocked, texture even and fairly fine. The wood has a density of 660?1060 kg/m_ at 12% moisture content, but wood from plantations often has a lower density than that from natural stands. The wood has a strong tendency to warp during drying. It is not stable in service. The wood is strong, tough and hard. The wood saws well and works well with hand and machine tools, but it splits easily and the presence of interlocked grain makes it somewhat difficult to finish. It holds nails well and glues well. The wood is durable and has good weathering and wearing properties. In Australia the wood is one of the most resistant to marine borerattack, but it failed after 2.5 - 10 years at the Pacific coast of the United States. The sapwood is susceptible to Lyctusborers. The heartwood is resistant to impregnation with preservatives, the sapwood is permeable The wood is red, hard, heavy, strong, very durable, uniform in texture and has an interlocked grain, which makes it difficult to work. It is resistant to marine borer and is widely used as a construction and mining timber. It is also used for poles, stakes, boxwoods, bridge timber, railway sleepers and wharves. It is suitable for posts of all sizes, flooring, vehicle bodies, furniture, handles, ladders, sporting goods, agricultural implements, veneer, plywood, core stock, matches, joinery, vats, toys, novelties, turnery and wood-wool. In India, the most important use of this species is for its good quality pulp and paper. The strength properties of the paper improve after the tree reaches 9 years of age, but the dark colour of the heartwood, in comparison with some other Eucalyptus species, is a disadvantage. It is also used for hardboard, fibreboard and particleboard. A popular and widely used firewood and charcoal. The energy value of the wood is17,750?22,000 kJ/kg."@en .

Because it has no major soil requirements, it is increasingly being used in reforestation programmes, both in flooded soils and in dry soils in tropical lowlands. Other Uses: The bark has a tannin content of over 10%, but it is not used commercially. The leaves yield a pale yellow oil. The major components of the oil are paecymene (76%), alpha-pinene (7%) and gamma terpenene (4%). The essential oil is a good source of paracymene, which possesses disinfectant properties and is utilized in soapmaking and in the perfumery industry. The heartwood is pinkish-brown to red-brown, and contains little gum. It is moderately durable, comparatively light compared to other Eucalypts, fairly easy to saw. It is used in heavy construction, bridging, flooring and framing. The round wood is used for building poles and fence posts. It is particularly suitable as a source of mid-density to low-density eucalypt fibre for pulp and paper production. It makes satisfactory fuel wood and charcoal. It has been used to produce hybrid species as it appears to be insect-resistant, including a timber with a trade name of 'Lyptus', hybridised with Eucalyptus grandis, commonly known as the rose gum or flooded gum."@en .

The essential oil from the leaves is used as a remedy for stomach pains, and is applied externally to treat skin diseases."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "The leaves contain up to 5% essential oil - the highest content occurring in regions of lower rainfall (1,100 mm annually), the lowest in more humid areas (2,200 mm annually). It is used in perfumery, making soaps, toilet waters etc. The essential oil contains eugenol, myrcine, chavicol and methyl-eugenol. To some people the sensory properties of the oil can be quite offensive, sickly sweet and nauseating; others perceive it as quite fresh and pleasant. Its flavour is warm, almost pungent, spicy and somewhat bitter. A yield of 500g of oil per 45 kilos of leaves has been obtained. Traditionally, the leaves are distilled with rum to produce bay rum, which has soothing and antiseptic properties and was formerly a very popular toilet water and hair tonic. In the production of terpeneless bay leaf oil, the terpenes (mostly the monoterpenes with a low boiling point) are removed by vacuum distillation. Myrcene is the most important compound removed. Terpeneless bay leaf oil is a pale straw-coloured to brownish-orange liquid with an intensely sweet, deep and mellow spicy-balsamic odour and lemon-like top note that is less pronounced than in the crude oil. It is easily dissolved in diluted alcohol, which is an advantage as it is often used in preparation with a low alcohol content, such as hair lotions. An absolute can be prepared by extracting the crude oil with alcohol. The absolute contains neither monoterpene nor sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Two different oils distilled from var. Racemosa have been reported: a lemon type and an anise type. Both types are reported from the Caribbean island Guadeloupe and may have been introduced into Java in the 1880s. The lemon type is rich in citral (geranial and neral); the anise type contains mainly methyl eugenol and estragol (methyl chavicol). Samples of var. Hispaniolensis were characterized by thymol and GAMMA-terpinene, 1,8-cineole and methyl eugenol, 1,8-cineole and methyl chavicol or 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol. Samples from var. Ozua were high in 1,8-cineole and ALFA-terpineol. The essential oil from var. Grisea was characterized by trans-methyl isoeugenol, methyl eugenol or geraniol. Var. Grisea is so common and has such a negative effect on the quality of the oil that it is called false bay rum tree. The essential oil is used as an insect repellent. The sapwood is light brown, and the heartwood brownish red or blackish and mottled. The wood is very hard, very heavy, strong, tough, durable and fine-grained. It is resistant to attack by dry-wood termites. The wood is used in carpentry, for making walking sticks, and for posts. It splits easily and is an excellent fuel."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is amenable to trimming and can be grown as a hedge or to provide shelter from the wind. In perennial plant systems it is often interplanted as a shade-provider with crops such as bananas, coffee and cocoa. The flowers are very attractive to bees, yielding a quality honey. Other Uses The bark contains 13 - 19% tannins. It has served in tanning and also yields a brown dye that has been used in colouring and preserving fishnets. The branches are used to whiten the teeth. The reddish-grey or reddish-brown heartwood is fine grained and is utilized in exterior joinery and carpentry. Wood is durable in water, resistant to termites, and although difficult to work, it saws and machines well and is used for construction, boat building, commercial tea and chest plywood, agricultural implements, tool handles, cart wheels, well curbs and troughs, sleepers, furniture and as props for shafts and galleries in mines. It is also used for building bridges and for making musical instruments, especially guitars."@en .

When cooked with custards or puddings, they impart a rose-like flavour. The large, hollow seed cavity is sometimes utilized to stuff the fruits and bake them .The fruit has to be handled very carefully after harvesting because it bruises easily and then loses its crispness. The fruit is up to 4cm x 6cm. Around the tropical world, the fruit is mostly eaten out-of-hand by children. It is seldom marketed. In the home, it is sometimes stewed with some sugar and served as dessert. The fruit can be distilled to yield a rosewater that is said to be equal to the best obtained from rose petals. Flowers - candied."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Several parts of the tree are used medicinally as a tonic or a diuretic. In India, the fruit is regarded as a tonic for the brain and liver. An infusion of the fruit acts as a diuretic. A sweetened preparation of the flowers is believed to reduce fever.. The seeds are employed against diarrhoea, dysentery and catarrh. In Nicaragua, it has been claimed that an infusion of roasted, powdered seeds is beneficial to diabetics. They say in Colombia that the seeds have an anaesthetic property. The leaf decoction is applied to sore eyes, also serves as a diuretic and expectorant and treatment for rheumatism. The juice of macerated leaves is taken as a febrifuge. Powdered leaves have been rubbed on the bodies of smallpox patients for the cooling effect. The bark contains 7-12.4% tannin. It is astringent, emetic and cathartic. The decoction is administered to relieve asthma, bronchitis and hoarseness. Cuban people believe that the root is an effective remedy for epilepsy."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: If the young plants are pruned severely, they become very dense and form an effective if not particularly handsome wind-break hedge. Plants develop massive root systems and can be useful for stabilizing soils on river banks. However, the dense top growth can stop any plant growth underneath, and this has sometimes led to sheet erosion unless the crown is thinned. Bees produce a heavy, consistent flow of amber honey from the flowers. Other Uses A yellow coloured essential oil, important in the perfume industry, is derived from the leaves by distillation. It contains, among other properties, 26.84% dl-a-pinene and 23.84% l-limonene, and can be resorted to as a source of these elements for use in the perfume industry. The bark contains 7% tannin on a dry weight basis and is used by local villagers for tanning and dyeing purposes. The bark also yields a brown dye. The flexible branches split easily. They are valued for making wattle, hoops for large sugar casks, and also are valued for weaving large baskets. The heartwood is dark-red or brown; the sapwood is white. The wood is straight and close-grained, medium-heavy to heavy, strong. It is not durable in the ground and is prone to attack by dry wood termites. It is usually too small for many purposes, but is commonly used for fenceposts, plant stakes etc, and larger pieces can be used to make furniture, spokes for wheels, arms for easy chairs, knees for all kinds of boats, beams for construction, frames for musical instruments (violins, guitars, etc.), and packing cases. It is also popular for general turnery. The wood makes an excellent fuel and charcoal."@en .
