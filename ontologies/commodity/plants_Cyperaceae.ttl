  :plant_medicinal_text "Piripiri has a long history of use in herbal medicine systems in South America. It is particularly valued for its beneficial effect upon the digestive system and is commonly used to treat nausea, vomiting, stomach-aches, and intestinal gas. The plant is anthelmintic, antibacterial, antiemetic, antifungal, carminative, contraceptive, digestive, febrifuge and sedative. More recently, interest has grown about the plants possible use in treating conditions such as epilepsy and convulsions. Researchers in Africa have published several studies which suggest that the plant can mediate many of the brain chemical reactions which are required in epilepsy and report that the rhizome has anti-epileptic actions. In addition, other laboratory research reports that the plant has anti-convulsant actions, as well as sedative actions. The fresh rhizomes are ground up to extract the juice, which is used as a nerve tonic in cases of stress and nervous and mental disorders (including epilepsy). It is also used to treat and prevent a wide range of digestive and gastrointestinal disorders; to treat fevers and flu; to facilitate child birth or to induce an abortion; as a contraceptive; and for throat cancer. Externally, it is used to heal wounds and treat snake bite, whilst it is also put on the head as a hair tonic and to treat or prevent baldness. A leaf infusion is employed for treating headaches; colds and flu; mouth sores and ulcers; and hypertension. The whole plant is decocted to relieve nausea and vomiting caused from malaria."@en ;

Other Uses The tall green stems are fibrous, round, and hollow and can be up to 18mm wide at the base. Piri-piri stems have sometimes been used like reeds in basket-making and other crafts. The stems are used for weaving into mats. The fragrant, sweet-scented, tuberous roots are used for perfuming clothing etc. Cyperus articulatus is largely pastured by cattle when nothing else is available."@en .

The stems are split and cut into usable pieces, soaked for 24 hours in clear water and then cooked for 1½ hours with lye. The fibres are then beaten in a blender and can be used to make a beige/brown paper. The stems and leaves are used for weaving or sewing together into hats, mats, mattresses etc. The stems are very durable and take a year or more to decay in the wild. The stems have been used in basket making. The outer surface of the stems has been split and twisted into weft cords and warp."@en .
