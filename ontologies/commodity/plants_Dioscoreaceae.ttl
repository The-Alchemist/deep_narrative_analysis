An arrowroot can be extracted from the root, though this is not as good at binding other foods as the starch from D. japonica. The root contains about 20% starch. 75% water, 0.1% vitamin B1, 10 - 15 mg% vitamin C. Fruit. A starchy flavour, it is said to be very good for the health. We wonder if this report is referring to the tubercles. We've heard the aerial tubers can be eaten and are very tasty. Carbon Farming - Staple Crop: basic starch."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "The Chinese yam, called Shan Yao in Chinese herbalism, is a sweet soothing herb that stimulates the stomach and spleen and has a tonic effect on the lungs and kidneys. The tuber contains allantoin, a cell-proliferant that speeds the healing process. The root is an ingredient of 'The herb of eight ingredients', traditionally prescribed in Chinese herbalism to treat hyperthyroidism, nephritis and diabetes. The tuber is anthelmintic, digestive and gently tonic. It is used internally in the treatment of tiredness, weight loss, poor appetite, poor digestion, chronic diarrhoea, asthma, dry coughs, frequent or uncontrollable urination, diabetes and emotional instability. It is applied externally to ulcers, boils and abscesses. The tubers are harvested in the autumn and can be used raw or baked. The leaf juice is used to treat snakebites and scorpion stings. The roots of most, if not all, members of this genus, contains diosgenin. This is widely used in modern medicine in order to manufacture progesterone and other steroid drugs. These are used as contraceptives and in the treatment of various disorders of the genitary organs as well as in a host of other diseases such as asthma and arthritis."@en ;

Both the tuber and the bulbil of wild races have medicinal uses. In particular they are used externally, usually as a poultice, to treat wounds, sores, boils and inflammations; in dressings for treating dermal parasitic and fungal infections; or crushed, mixed with palm oil, and massaged onto areas of rheumatism, and for troubles of the breasts and for jiggers. In India the tuber is considered to be diuretic and to be a remedy for diarrhoea and haemorrhoids. The fruits are used to treat boils and for fever. Sap expressed from the vine stems is applied to treat purulent ophthalmia, and for snake-bite. The leaves are used, often by steam-distillation, against pink-eye. Various medically active substances have been detected in the plant. Dioscorine has been detected in the tuber, though certain Nigerian material has been reported free of the alkaloid. Alkaloids have been reported from the leaves and stems and particularly in the fruits. Diosgenin has been detected at 0?45% concentration. Saponin is present and a number of other pharmacologically active substances."@en ;
