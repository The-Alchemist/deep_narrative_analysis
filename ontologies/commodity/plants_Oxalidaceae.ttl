The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Flies, Butterflies. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."@en ;

  :plant_edible_text "Edible portion: Fruit, Flowers, Leaves. Fruit - raw. The fruit is crisp and juicy with a waxy yellow skin when ripe. The best forms are delicious on their own, they also go very well in fruit salads, juiced and mixed with other fruits etc. The fruit flavour is enhanced by peeling off the 'wing' edges, which removes most of the oxalic acid. A quince-like fragrance. Plants can produce fruit all year round. Fruit quality is variable, though they are normally juicy. Sour forms, and slightly immature fruits, are pickled or made into a relish. The orange-yellow fruit is a large, indehiscent berry, 5-8 cm long with a characteristic shape in cross-section resembling a 5-pointed star. The fruit is up to 12.5cm x 6cm. Flowers - raw. An acid flavour, they are added to salads. They can also be made into conserves. Leaves - raw or cooked. An acid flavour, they are used as a sorrel substitute."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The fruit can be a laxative on account of the oxalic acid it contains. It is also used in traditional medicine for skin disorders and fevers. It is valued by Chinese communities as a remedy for high blood pressure, whilst it is also said to reduce blood sugar levels and so is of help to diabetics. The flowers are used to relieve coughs. The leaves are used to treat rheumatism. The seed is emmenagogue, galactagogue and abortifacient. The powdered seed is a good anodyne for treating asthma, colic and jaundice."@en ;

Other Uses In some countries, the fruit juice is used to remove stains, for example iron rust from linen cloth. It can also be used for polishing brass. The fresh juice is an effective stain remover. Unripe fruits contain potassium oxalate, which is used in dyeing. The whitish wood is soft. Generally only available in small dimensions, it is sometimes used for timber in construction and for making small implements, furniture etc. The wood is a suitable candidate for firewood."@en .
