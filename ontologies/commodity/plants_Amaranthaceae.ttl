However, many of the species in this genus contain saponins, though usually in quantities too small to do any harm. Although toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down to a large extent in the cooking process. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish. The plants also contain some oxalic acid, which in large quantities can lock up some of the nutrients in the food, but these plants are very nutritious vegetables in reasonable quantities. Cooking the plant will reduce its content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition. There is also a report that very large quantities of the leaves have caused photosensitivity in some people. Only the raw leaves can cause problems, and then only if large quantities are consumed. A further report says that if the plant is grown in soils that contain too much nitrates then the plant can concentrate these substances in the leaves. Nitrates have been shown to cause many health problems including stomach cancers and blue-baby syndrome. In nitrogen-rich soils, the plants can also concentrate hydrogen cyanide. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer.

  :plant_medicinal_text "Wormseed is a Central American herb that has been used for centuries to expel parasitic worms from the body. The seed, or the essential oil obtained from the seed and flowering stem is used for this, though all parts of the plant are used medicinally. The plant, especially the essential oil, is toxic in larger doses and so should be used with care and preferably under the direction of a skilled practitioner. This remedy should not be prescribed for pregnant women. See also the notes above on toxicity. Until fairly recently, this was one of the most commonly used vermifuges, though it has now been largely replaced by synthetic drugs. The seed, or the essential oil, was used. It is very effective against most parasites, including the amoeba that causes dysentery, but is less effective against tapeworm. Fasting should not precede its use and there have occasionally been cases of poisoning caused by this treatment. The essential oil is used externally to treat athlete's foot and insect bites. This is at its highest concentration in the flowering stems before seed is set, these contain around 0.7% essential oil of which almost 50% is the active vermifuge ascaridol. The essential oil is of similar quality from plants cultivated in warm climates and those in cool climates. The whole plant is analgesic, antiasthmatic, carminative, febrifuge, stomachic and vermifuge. An infusion can be used as a digestive remedy, being taken to settle a wide range of problems such colic, diarrhoea and stomach pains; it is also used to treat conditions such as coughs, fevers and internal haemorrhages. The leaves are added in small quantities as a flavouring for various cooked bean dishes because their carminative activity can reduce flatulence. Externally, it has been used as a wash for haemorrhoids, as a poultice to detoxify snake bites and other poisons and is thought to have wound-healing properties. The macerated leaves and flowers are mixed with a pinch of salt, and used as a poultice for treating persistent sores. The essential oil is high in ascaridol, a nematicidal terpene peroxide which is active against ascaris, worms and ankylostomes."@en ;

Regarded as a general cure-all, it was and is used as a tonic and rejuvenating herb to treat a wide range of illnesses and restore virility to the body. In modern herbal medicine the root is considered to be an adaptogen and a tonic, able to increase the body's resistance to adverse influences by a wide range of physical, chemical, and biochemical factors and having a normalizing or restorative effect on the body as a whole. It is taken to stimulate appetite and circulation; increase oestrogen production; balance blood sugar levels; enhance the immune system; strengthen the muscular system; enhance memory; and as a general restorative tonic after illness. It is used to treat exhaustion and chronic fatigue; impotence; arthritis; anaemia; diabetes; cancer; high blood pressure; PMS, menopause, and hormonal disorders; and many types of stress. The root contains 19 different amino acids, a large number of electrolytes, trace minerals, iron, magnesium, zinc, vitamins A, B1, B2, E, K , and pantothenic acid. Its high germanium content probably accounts for its properties as an oxygenator at the cellular level; its high iron content may account for its traditional use for anaemia. The root also contains novel phytochemicals including saponins, pfaffic acids, glycosides, and nortriterpenes. Saponins are well known to have a wide spectrum of activities including lowering blood cholesterol; inhibiting cancer cell growth; and acting as antifungal and antibacterial agents. They are also known as natural detergent and foaming agents. Phytochemists report that saponins can act by binding with bile acids and cholesterol. It is thought that these chemicals 'clean' or purge these fatty compounds from the body (thus lowering blood cholesterol levels). The specific saponins found in the roots of suma include a group of novel phytochemicals named pfaffosides. These saponins have clinically demonstrated the ability to inhibit tumour cell melanomas and help to regulate blood sugar levels. Pfaffia has demonstrated analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in various studies."@en ;

  :plant_hazards "The leaves of most varieties of spinach are high in oxalic acid. Although not toxic, this substance does lock up certain minerals in a meal, especially calcium, making them unavailable to the body. Therefore mineral deficiencies can result from eating too much of any leaf that contains oxalic acid. However, the mineral content of spinach leaves is quite high so the disbenifits are to a large extent outweighed by the benefits. There are also special low-oxalic varieties of spinach that have been developed. Cooking the leaves will also reduce the content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition. Possible methaemoglobinaemia from nitrates in children under 4 months. Anticoagulant patients should avoid excessive intake due to vitamin K content ."@en ;
