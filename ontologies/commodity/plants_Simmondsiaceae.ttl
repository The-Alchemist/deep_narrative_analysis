  :plant_physical_characteristics "Simmondsia Chinensis is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a slow rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 10. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid, very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought."@en ;

  :plant_edible_text "Seed - raw or cooked. Often parched and then eaten. It is also been made into a well-flavoured drink similar to coffee."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The wax obtained from the seed is applied to the skin in order to alleviate the effects of psoriasis, sores, wounds and other skin afflictions. It has been used traditionally as a medicine for cancer, kidney disorders, colds, dysuria, obesity, parturition, aching eyes and warts, and to treat baldness."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Planted in arid areas as a means of preventing soil erosion. The plant makes an attractive clipped hedge. Other Uses: A liquid wax is obtained from the seed. After ripening and harvesting in the summer, the seeds are crushed and give a liquid wax yield of about 50% by weight. This wax, often referred to as jojobe oil, is a unique unsaturated oil composed of non-glyceride esters consisting almost entirely of straight-chain acids and alcohols. These compounds are difficult to synthesise commercially and the only other source is the sperm whale. The waxes are indigestible, odourless and clear, the processes of isomerisation, hydrogenation and sulphur-chloride treatments produce a range of products from thick creams to crystalline waxes to oils and rubbers. Jojoba wax, and especially its sulphur-containing derivatives, are stable at high temperatures, which make them suitable as components of industrial oils, as additives in high pressure and high-temperature lubricants for transformers and gear systems, and as cutting and drawing oils in metal working. The oil or derivatives have potential as a motor fuel. Jojoba methyl-ester fuel runs more quietly than conventional diesel fuel and releases no sulphur. The liquid wax can be converted to a hard wax used, for example, in manufacturing candles. Other applications have been found in the manufacture of linoleum and printing inks. The composition of jojoba wax enables it to withstand high temperatures of up to 300°c since it has a flash point of 295°c, a fire point of 338°c, and a low volatility. Jojoba wax has properties similar to the oil secreted by human skin and can be used to lubricate skin and hair for protection against e.g. ultraviolet radiation. The wax is relatively nontoxic, biodegradable and resistant to rancidity."@en .
