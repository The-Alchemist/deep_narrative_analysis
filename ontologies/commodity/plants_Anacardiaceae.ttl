  :plant_edible_text "Edible portion: Nut, Leaves, Fruit pulp, Flavouring, Vegetable, Seeds, Oil. Fruit - raw or cooked. Juicy and refreshing, though they are a bit acidic and often have an astringency that can leave your mouth feeling furry. They are also somewhat fibrous. They can also be dried or sliced with other fruits. The fruit can also be lightly cooked to get rid of their astringency. A refreshing juice can be extracted from the fruit. Red fruits are considered to be superior to yellow fruits. The apple is used to make spirits. The fruit is about 3cm long. Seed - must be cooked before being removed from its shell. Slightly sweet with a pleasant, bland flavour. Eaten on their own, salted and used in a wide range of confections. They can also be used as the basis of savoury protein-rich meat-alternative dishes. Caution should be employed when harvesting the seed - see notes above on toxicity. An edible oil is obtained from the seed but, due to the high value of the seed, the oil is not usually extracted. Young leaves and shoots - raw in salads or cooked. Eaten in S.E. Asia, but too astringent for most tastes. They are picked during the rainy season and eaten fresh with hot and spicy dishes. One of our users, Carol, from the tropics of northern Australia, kindly forwarded the following information. Safely processing cashew nuts at home. 1. It is best to fill a lidded oven-safe pot with sand and bury the unopened nuts completely in the sand.  Use an old pot as after processing the pot will not be suitable to use for any other purpose due to traces of the caustic latex that may remain behind. I have a lidded casserole dish dedicated solely for this purpose. 2. Preheat the oven to around 250 deg C and roast the nuts in their shell for 10 minutes. Make sure to have windows open and the kitchen well ventilated as the heat causes the shell to crack and the caustic latex to ooze out. While the sand will absorb the oil, it may also emit a caustic choking smoke, avoid inhaling this!  Take extreme care opening the oven door. I would recommend taking the lidded pot outdoors before removing the lid. Better still, if you have an outdoor stove, use that from the start. 3. Wear disposable gloves when you open the pot and carefully remove the nuts from the sand as they may have some oil residue. Place the whole roasted nuts in a dish of water and detergent and thoroughly wash them. 4. It should now be safe to open the shell and remove the kernel. Finally, remove the thin brown papery cover from the kernel. 5. Note that if any of the latex has stuck to the roasted kernel during processing then that nut(kernel) is not edible and must be thrown out. 6. If like me you are a hobby gardener or a subsistence farmer, and not growing commercial quantities, the unopened nuts can be stored for a couple of years until enough nuts have been stored to warrant processing. My tree produced one cashew apple and nut in its first year and I certainly was not going to go through that process for one solitary nut!"@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The leaves are febrifuge. They are used in west Africa in the treatment of malaria. In India and Africa the leaves are used to treat toothache and gum problems. The leaves can be harvested at any time and dried for later use. The bark is astringent, rubefacient and vesicant. Research has shown that it is also hypoglycaemic, having the ability to reduce blood sugar levels. The bark is used in Ayurvedic medicine to detoxify snake bites. The bark is harvested as required and used fresh or dried. Leaf and bark infusions are used in the treatment of toothache and sore gums, whilst the bark and leaf extracts and fruit juice are taken internally to treat diarrhoea. The fruit is anti-scorbutic, astringent and diuretic. Cashew syrup is a good remedy for coughs and colds. Cashew apple juice is said to be effective for the treatment of syphilis, and is also used in the treatment of cholera and kidney troubles. The fresh, acrid juice inside the shell is vesicant. It has been used for removing warts as well as for treating ringworm, leprosy and corns, and is applied to the soles of the feet to cure cracks in the skin. It is toxic to many disease-causing organisms, such as Staphylococcus bacteria. The sap, or bark extract, is considered to be contraceptive. The gum is bactericidal, fungicidal and kills worms and protozoa. It is applied externally in the treatment of leprosy, and for corns and fungal conditions. An infusion of the root is an excellent purgative."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Backyard Tree, Courtyard, Large Planter; xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: Because it grows well on poor sandy soils and near the coast, it has sometimes planted for erosion control. It has been intercropped with cowpea, groundnuts and horsegram in India. In Andra Pradesh and Orissa in India, casuarina and coconut constitute a popular crop combination. Plants are often used as a support for growing cultivated vanilla. Other Uses The fruits contain 45 - 47% oil which has high heat resistance. It is an excellent lubricant and is also used in varnishes, inks, termite proofing wood, insulating coatings etc. The bark contains an acrid sap of thick brown resin, which becomes black on exposure to air. This is used as indelible ink in marking and printing linens and cottons. The resin is also used as a varnish, a preservative for fishnets and a flux for solder metals. The stem yields an amber-coloured gum, which is partly soluble in water, the main portion swelling into a jellylike mass. This gum is used as an adhesive (for woodwork panels, plywood, bookbinding), partly because it has insecticidal properties. It is also used in inks, dyes and varnishes. The acrid sap of the bark contains 3-5% tannin and is employed in the tanning industry. One of the components of the bark gum acts as a vesicant and has insect repellent properties. The toxic, acrid oil in the shell has high polymerizing and friction-reducing properties and is used as a waterproofing agent and preservative. It can be used for treating fishing nets, woodwork etc in order to repel termites. The oil in the shell can also be added to paraffin to make it more effective in controlling mosquito larvae. It has been used in the manufacture of plastics, and in the manufacture of certain sorts of paints such as are used for ship's keels, cement surfaces and where corrosive influences preclude the use of ordinary paint. Distilled and polymerized, the oil is also used in insulating varnishes and in the manufacture of typewriter rolls, oil- and acid-proof cements and tiles, friction-modifying material for brake linings, as a component of space-rocket lubricants, inks, etc. The reddish-brown wood is light in weight, fairly hard, but is subject to termite attack. It is sometimes used for construction and general carpentry. It is usually of unsuitable dimensions for construction. Pulp from the wood is used to fabricate corrugated and hardboard boxes. The wood makes a good charcoal and fuel. The residue of the shell is often used as fuel in cashew nut shell liquid extraction plants."@en .

It is an excellent timber for external work, being used for railroad ties, telegraph posts, bridge timbers, posts and piles. The wood is a source of muiracatiara timber. We have no more specific information, but a general description of muiracatiara timber is as follows:- The heartwood is pinkish-brown to yellow-brown, becoming red-brown to dark brown with very irregularly spaced black-brown veins; it is clearly demarcated from the 4 - 10cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is fine; the grain straight or interlocked. The wood is heavy, hard and very durable, being resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons normally with little risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. It has a fairly high blunting effect upon toold, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but pre-boring is necessary; gluing is poor. The wood has a wide range of applications, being used in cabinet making for high class furniture, for flooring, turnery, interior and exterior joinery, heavy carpentry, tool handles, musical instruments, carving etc."@en .

To obtain the varnish, V-shaped incisions, 22cm long and 15cm apart at the base, are cut on the bark of the trees, the apex pointing down. The tongue of bark within these scars is then slightly lifted up and a specially prepared joint of bamboo driven in horizontally immediately below the apex of the incision. The sap which exudes from the inner bark drains into the bamboo receiver. This is emptied at the end of ten days, when the flow of varnish is observed to become scanty. A second cut is made along each side of the contained tongue of bark, which is also again raised up slightly and the bamboo receiver placed more conveniently to the new scarification. After this has yielded all the varnish that seems likely, a new incision is made a little higher up. It would appear that young trees yield better than fully formed ones. The tree is largely utilised in its liquid state as a natural varnish, and has the great merit of preserving woodwork. Thickened by sawdust, cow-dung ashes, or bone-ashes to a plastic condition, it is employed as a cement and body material or moulding substance. It may be coloured with lamp-black, gold-leaf, vermilion (not red lead), orpiment, indigo, etc., and applied with a brush or by the hand direct, or to objects revolving on the turning-lathe. When painted on cloth or paper the form used is very thin and pure, but on drying the articles are found to have been rendered waterproof. A resinous exudate from the wood can cause severe skin irritation. The poisonous constituent of the resinous sap is volatile and will gradually disappear. For this reason, the timber of this tree must be dried and exposed for several years as it is otherwise dangerous to handle. Lacquered articles or furniture made from the dried timber may still be toxic to persons who are especially susceptible. We have no specific description for the wood of this species - the following description is a general one for the timber producing species in this genus. The heartwood is a deep blood red, darkening on exposure, streaked with bands of darker colour; the sapwood is a light pink brown to almost white, usually rather wide. The texture is rather fine to moderately coarse; the grain straight to irregular; without characteristic odour or taste; mostly without lustre; only moderately durable and not highly resistant to termite attack. The green material is easier to cut than the dry wood; it works well with hand and machine tools and dresses smoothly; takes a high polish; there can be a severe dulling of cutters due to silica content. The wood is used for fine furniture, turnery, cabinetwork, specialty items, decorative veneers, joinery."@en .

Leaf decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, colds, fevers and gonorrhoea. The leaves are also used in an abortifacient preparation. A decoction of the leaves and young stems is used as an eyewash in ophthalmia. The flowers are cardiac and stomachic. A decoction is used in the treatment of laryngitis, ophthalmia and children's diarrhoea. The fruit is mildly laxative. It is stewed and eaten to cure diarrhoea."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The tree is occasionally planted to provide shade for coffee plants. It is sometimes utilized for living fence posts. Other Uses Ashes from the roots have been used in making soap. The heartwood is cream to buff in colour; it is not demarcated from the sapwood. The texture is medium to coarse; the grain straight to slightly irregular; lustre is medium; there is no distinguishable odour or taste. The wood is light in weight, soft; it is somewhat durable, with a low resistance to attack by decay fungi and insects, and is particularly prone to blue stain. It air dries rapidly, but develops moderate warp and slight checking. It is easy to work and generally finishes smoothly, though fuzzy grain may develop in some operations. The trunks are occasionally used for dugouts and the stems for posts, boxes, matches, general carpentry, tool handles, millwork, utility plywood, and furniture components. Logs need to be promptly processed to minimize deterioration from insect attack. Its hardness, density and light colour make the tree useful for wood pulp. The resulting paper has good resistance to tension and tearing but a poor reaction to folding. The wood is suitable for fuel."@en .

Even quite large limbs when cut and set in the ground take root quickly, and often are set thickly to form immediate barriers. Other Uses In some regions the ashes of the wood are used in soap-making. Some cosmetic and hygienic products eg soap are manufactured from parts of this tree. The seeds have a thick gum coating commonly used in chilli stews. This gum has good solubility in water and on hydrolysis yields polysaccharides. Aspartic acid and valine are its major amino acid constituents. The whitish wood is soft, light in weight and brittle. It is said to have been used in Brazil for paper pulp.
