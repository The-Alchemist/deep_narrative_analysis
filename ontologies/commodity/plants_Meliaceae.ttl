  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Being drought resistant with a well-developed root system capable of extracting nutrient from the lower soil levels, it is a suitable tree for dune-fixation.  The large crown makes it an effective shade tree, planted widely as an avenue tree in towns and villages and along roads in many tropical countries. Because of its low branching, it is a valuable asset for use as a windbreak.  Intercropping A. Indica with pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum, has given good results in India  Farmers in India use neem cake (the residue left after extracting oil from the seeds) as an organic manure and soil amendment. It is believed to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizers by reducing the rate of nitrification and inhibiting soil pests including nematodes, fungi, and insects. The leaves and small twigs are used as mulch and green manure. The dried leaves are insect repellent, they are used like mothballs in linen cupboards and also placed within books in libraries  The neem tree is a potent insect repellent. The principal active compound is called azadirachtin. Extracts can be made from leaves and other tissues, but the seeds contain the highest concentrations of the compound  It acts as an insect repellent, inhibiting feeding, and disrupting insect growth, metamorphosis and reproduction. Formulations based on neem do not usually kill insects directly but alter their behaviour in significant ways to reduce pest damage to crops, and reduce their reproductive potential. Azadirachtin affects insect physiology by mimicking a natural hormone. It has been shown to affect egg production and hatching rates. Azadirachtin can inhibit moulting, preventing larvae from developing into pupae. Many foliage-feeding species avoid plants treated with neem compounds or cease eating after ingesting the neem. Its has proven effective as an antifeedant on about 100 insect species. Thus the extracts work especially well to protect plants from defoliation without affecting beneficial pollinating insects like honeybees  A traditional agricultural practice involves the production of ?neem tea?. The seeds are dried, crushed and soaked in water overnight to produce a liquid pesticide that can be applied directly to crops. Crushed seed kernels are also used as a dry pesticide application, especially to control stem borers on young plants. These homemade remedies are often very effective in repelling pests or acting on insects as a feeding deterrent. The strength of homemade preparations can vary due to the concentration of azadirachtin and other compounds in the seed, which can in turn depends on the genetic source of the seeds. It can also be affected by the process of handling and drying the seeds, contaminants in the water, and exposure to high temperatures or sunlight. The active compounds break down quickly, so an application of neem tea generally provides protection for only about 1 week. A non-drying oil extracted from the seed, called margosa oil, has insecticidal properties. It is also used in hair dressings. The oil can also be used as a fuel in lamps. The oil has long been produced in Asia on an industrial scale for soaps, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other non-edible products. The seed oil yield is sometimes as high as 50% of the weight of the kernel  A resin, obtained from the trunk by wounding the bark, is added to soap, toothpaste and skin lotions. This high-protein material has potential as a food additive and is widely used in Southeast Asia as 'neem glue'.  People use the twigs as toothbrushes, and dentists find twigs effective in preventing periodontal disease  The tree bark contains 12-14% tannins. This compares favourably with conventional tannin chemicals."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Wood - the grain is rough and does not polish well. It is highly prized for its insecticidal properties. The wood is used to make wardrobes, bookcases and closets, as well as packing cases because of its insect repellent quality. The wood is so highly valued as an insecticide that in some areas of Africa the tree is grown in hedges in order to provide easily obtained supplies of the wood. The main stem of the tree is also widely used to make posts for construction or fencing because the wood is termite resistant. Charcoal made from the wood is of excellent quality and the wood has long been used as firewood."@en .

Foresters recognize two types of wood from this tree:- Andiroba Vermelha, also known as 'Red' or 'Hill Crabwood' is derived from trees growing on higher, well-drained land. It produces a heavier wood of superior quality which does not float on water. Andiroba Branca, also known as 'White Crabwood', is derived from trees growing in swampy locations. The wood is lighter, of lower quality and does float on water. The heartwood is reddish-brown; it is not clearly demarcated from the 3 - 5cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain straight or interlocked. The wood is moderately soft to moderately hard; strong; moderately tough; of medium weight, moderately durable with some resistance to fungi and termites, but susceptible to dry wood borers. It is somewhat slow to season, with a high risk of checking but only a slight risk of distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It works quite well with ordinary tools, though there are some difficulties in planing when the grain is interlocked; it has a slight tendency to split on nailing or screwing, so pre-boring is recommended; it glues well and polishes satisfactorily. The wood's main application is for high-quality furniture and cabinetwork, stairs and flooring, and as veneer for furniture, interior work and plywood. It is also used for masts, building material, boxes and crates, and as a substitute for okoum? (Aucoumea klineana) and walnut (Juglans regia). In Colombia, shoemakers prefer it for making shoe pieces. The wood is suitable for the production of pulp and paper."@en .

The wood of the bole, and particularly of the buttresses, is beautifully marked but difficult to work. An important timber tree, used mainly for furniture, it is also used for Chinese coffins and construction. The wood is suitable for medium to heavy construction work, planking, flooring, panelling, and for manufacturing high grade furniture, wood pallets, veneer and plywood. We have no more specific information on the wood of this species, but it is one of a group of species that are the source of a commercial timber known in the trade as 'jarum-jarum'. The general description of jarum-jarum is as follows:- The heartwood is orange-red to brick red when fresh,darkening on exposure; it is clearly demarcated from the yellow sapwood. The texture is moderately coarse but uneven due to the abundant of parenchyma; the grain is straight, interlocked, wavy or irregular; there is a watersilk marking on flat-sawn surfaces due to the parenchyma bands. The wood is moderately hard to hard. It is used for purposes such as flooring, furniture, wall panelling, solid door construction, veneer and plywood."@en .

The wood seasons normally, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion when in the presence of highly interlocked grain and tension wood; once dried it is stable in service. The timber works well with nornal tools, though these need to be sharp since there is a tendency to be woolly in cross grain; nailing and screwing are good, though pre-boring is recommended; gluing is correct. The wood is favoured for good quality furniture, high-class joinery, trim and boat building. The wood is also used locally for railroad ties, flooring, turnery and veneer. Because of its decorative appearance, the wood is a very popular timber. The wood is used in West Africa for pulp. Only limited quantities are available for fuel wood, and trees of larger dimensions are undesirable because of difficulties with splitting and crosscutting. Hence, even if fuel wood is in short supply, larger-diameter sections are not utilized. The gross energy value of the wood is 19 990 kJ/kg."@en .

It has been used in reforestation projects and has proved to be suitable in areas not protected from grazing. It is used as a shade tree, for example, for cacao, coffee and young plantations of dipterocarps. When young, it can be used as an under-crop for teak (Tectona grandis), where its ability to facilitate heavy thinning of the latter without exposing the soil to the risk of serious desiccation and erosion, is quite promising and worth great consideration. In Puerto Rico, farmers have planted it among subsistence crops such as corn, beans, bananas, sweet potatoes and cassava. The crushed fruit shells have been used as a potting medium. Other Uses A gum is produced from cuts in the bark. It is marketed in both pure form and mixed with other gums. The bark is used for dyeing and tanning leather. An oil, which is very bitter and purgative, can be extracted from the seed kernels. It might be of some commercial value.

The attractive wood is particularly valued for high-class furniture and cabinet work, it has also been used in interior panelling, joinery work, turnery, plywood and heavy construction work. Its outstanding technical qualities make it particularly suitable for precision woodwork such as models and patterns, instrument cases, clocks, printer?s blocks and parts of musical instruments.

Other Uses An oil can be extracted from the seed kernels which might be of some commercial value. The bark is a source of tannins and has been used for dyeing. The crushed fruit shells have been used as a potting medium. The heartwood is reddish or pinkish, the colour darkening with age to a deep red or brown; it is distinctly demarcated from the up to 40mm wide band of usually yellowish sapwood.

The wood seasons well, without much checking or distortion and kiln dries satisfactorily when moderate schedules are used. Rates of shrinkage are low and uniform, after drying it is stable in service. It saws, planes and moulds easily in both green and dry condition; in general it finishes to an exceptionally smooth, lustrous surface, but a woolly surface may occur on bands of reaction wood or interlocked grain; finishing is easy and the wood takes an excellent polish, gluing and nailing properties are good, but discoloration in contact with iron, copper and brass may occur under humid conditions. The wood slices and rotary cuts into fine and decorative veneer, without preliminary treatment, at a peeling angle of 92?. The wood is therefore the choice for high-quality furniture and cabinetwork, joinery, boats and pattern work. Wood carvers use a significant amount of the wood in turnery and sculpture. The wood's outstanding technical qualities make it particularly suitable for precision woodwork such as models and patterns, instrument cases, clocks, printer?s blocks and parts of musical instruments; for these purposes, uniform straight-grained material is used. Other minor uses include burial caskets, novelties and expensive toys.

The bark and fruits can be used for production of essential oils. Extracts from the bark, heartwood and leaves apparently have insecticidal qualities. Fibres obtained from the bark are used in making string bags. The heartwood is light red or brown; it is distinctly demarcated from the sapwood, which is white, pink, or pale red. The wood is moderately durable but susceptible to dry-termite and borer attack. It is sweetly aromatic when cut, easy to saw and has good woodworking properties; some material tends to produce a wooly finish and it is therefore essential to use sharp tools; mortising, turning, and sanding give moderate results, but boring sometimes gives poor results; gluing and nailing properties are rated as good but the nail-holding strength is moderate. An excellent timber, it is used for high-class cabinet wood, furniture, interior finishing, decorative panelling, crafts, musical instruments, cigar boxes, veneers, boxes and for construction."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "Throughout Africa the seed oil, leaves, root and bark are used in similar ways uses to those of Trichilia emetica, though they are generally considered to be inferior. They are used to treat a variety of complaints ranging from lumbago to leprosy and sleeplessness. A large number of limonoids have been isolated from the seed, especially from the seedcoat. including evodulone and prieurianin derivatives. Limonoids of other plants in this family (Meliaceae) are well known as antifeedants and growth regulators of insects, but they also have some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. The bark, which is very toxic, contains inhibitors of the prostaglandin-synthesis, which play a role in inflammation and pain suppression. The seed oil is rubbed into cuts made in the skin of a fractured limb in order to hasten healing. It is used as a massage oil to treat rheumatism and as a general body ointment. The fruit has emetic and purgative properties. Poultices made of the leaves or fruits are applied to bruises and eczema. A decoction of the roots is used as a general tonic; to treat fever; and as a purgative. It is also used to induce labour in pregnant women; and to treat intestinal worms, colds and infertility. A decoction of the bark is drunk as a purgative or abortifacient, and also to treat dysentery and diarrhoea, fevers and lumbago. The bark is used externally as a treatment against scabies. Decoctions of the bark, applied in the form of an enema, are used as a purgative and abortifacient, as well as to treat back pain caused by kidney problems."@en ;

Other Uses The seeds contain 55 - 65% oil. This is used as a body ointment and hair oil, as well as to make candles, soap and cosmetics. The approximate fatty acid composition of the oil is: palmitic acid 34%, stearic acid 3%, oleic acid 51%, linoleic acid 11%, linolenic acid 1%. To obtain the oil, the seeds are first ground into a powder and pounded, they are then boiled in water and the oil is skimmed off. The heartwood is pale brown to pink, the sapwood whitish, though the wood darkens with age and exposure. When oiled, it darkens considerably, leaving little difference between the heartwood and sapwood. The grain is generally straight, texture medium coarse, the wood has a distinct figure. The wood is not durable and is subject to attack by borers. It is easily worked and polishes well. It is not durable and susceptible to borer attack. The wood is particularly important as a material for making carvings, especially in southern Africa, and is also used for indoor furniture, household utensils, shelving, construction, dugout canoes etc. The wood is used for fuel and for making charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant greatly assists in soil conservation. It is widely planted as a windbreak in urban and rural areas. It is sometimes used in reforestation projects. The pressed seedcake left after oil has been extracted, with an approximate protein content of 16%, is suitable as a fertilizer. The plant is regarded as an indicator of areas with palatable grass species. Other Uses Two different oils are obtained from the seed - that from the fleshy envelope around the seed is called 'Mafura oil' and is edible; whilst that from the kernel, called 'Mafura butter' is too bitter to be eaten. Commercially, the two oils are often extracted together without trying to separate them. The fleshy envelope around the seed contains 14 - 51% oil. As well as being edible, it produces a good finish on wood surfaces and could compete successfully with other commercial wood oils. The kernel contains 68% oil. It is used for making candles. The oil produced from the kernels and coats of the seed combined is very good for making soap. It is sometimes used as a cosmetic and can also be used for preserving foodstuffs. The leaves can be used as a soap. An aqueous extract of the leaves has shown pronounced antifungal properties against a number of plant pathogens. The crushed seed almost completely protected cowpea seed from storage pests when mixed at a dosage of 1%. A pinkish dye is obtained from the bark. The wood is used as chewsticks to maintain oral health. The wood is usually pinkish in colour with no real distinction between he sapwood and heartwood. It is soft and light, yet firm and works well. It is vulnerable to borers and should be treated accordingly. The wood produces beautiful furniture, which darkens with the application of furniture oil. It is also good quality for shelving, and is popular for carvings, musical instruments and various household articles. The wood is one of the most important timbers used in woodcarving in southern Africa. Owing to its flexibility and good turning properties, it is also good for tool handles and spears. Trees with long, straight trunks are traditionally cut and used for dugout canoes. The wood is commonly used for fuel."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The heartwood is creamy white to pale yellow, darkening to golden yellow upon exposure to light; it is indistinctly demarcated from the 5 - 6cm wide band of sapwood. The grain is straight to interlocked; texture fine and even; the wood distinctly lustrous, with a silky shine; quartersawn surfaces often have an attractive mottled figure. The wood is medium weight; soft; it is not durable, being susceptible to fungal, dry-wood borer, termite and marine borer attacks. With some care, it air dries fairly easily and rapidly, but there is a serious risk of distortion and slight risk of checking. The wood saws and works well with ordinary equipment and with only slight dulling effects on saw teeth and cutting edges; tearing may occur in planing because of the presence of interlocked grain; it can be polished to an excellent finish; splitting is common during nailing and screwing, and pre-boring is recommended; gluing, painting and varnishing properties are all good, but the bending properties are poor. Sliced veneer of excellent quality can be produced, but the logs are often too irregular to produce good results in peeling. A valuable and decorative wood, it is used for a range of purposes including high-quality furniture, cabinet making, decorative carpentry, moulding and panelling, musical instruments, and for sliced veneer. It is suitable for light construction, flooring, ship building, vehicle bodies, toys, novelties, boxes, crates, vats, turnery, hardboard, particle board and pulpwood for paper roduction. The wood is used for fuel and for charcoal production. The whitish wood is light and easy to work. It is used for general carpentry and the interior finishes of houses."@en .
