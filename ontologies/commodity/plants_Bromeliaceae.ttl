The fibre is white, soft, silky, flexible, and long in staple; it is remarkably durable, and unaffected by immersion in water. It can be employed as a substitute for silk, and as a material for mixing with wool or cotton. It is also useful for cordage, textile fabrics, sewing silk or twist, laces, as a material for stringing necklaces etc. It produces the celebrated pina cloth of the Philippine Islands.
