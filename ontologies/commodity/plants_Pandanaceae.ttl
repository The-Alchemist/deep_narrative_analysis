  :plant_edible_text "Edible Portion: Fruit, Spice. The red fruit is high in oil. The ripe fruit is cooked then the juice mixed with water to make a sauce.  To do this, a ripe marita fruit is normally split into 3 sections along its length.  Then the central yellow stalk and pith area are dug out.  The outside hard red layer is then cooked.  Preferably it is cooked using hot stones although sometimes it is boiled in a saucepan.  After cooking for about half an hour the hard pits are squeezed from the soft red juice by squeezing through the hands.  Water is added to make an oily red soup.  The soup is then eaten.  Sometimes it is eaten by dipping green leaves or sago into the soup.  At other times it is eaten with a spoon made from the marita leaf.  Some people just suck the cooked juice from the seeds.  As well, some people use the oily juice to cook food in.  The pits or seeds are thrown away, normally to pigs.  A harvested marita fruit will only keep for about one week.  After cooking it will only last for about 12 hours.
