Wall of the USDA and Jonathon Hartwell of the National Cancer Institute in the United States. The bark and stems of Camptotheca acuminata contain the alkaloid camptothecin. Several chemical derivatives of camptothecin are under investigation for or used as drugs for cancer treatment, including irinotecan, topotecan, rubitecan. Camptotheca acuminata also contains the chemical compounds trifolin and hyperoside."@en ;

A tea or tincture of the astringent root bark has been used as a quinine substitute to treat malaria and also in the treatment of chronic diarrhoea. The bark has also been used as a poultice on external ulcers, wounds etc. The glycoside 'cornin' found in the bark has astringent properties. The inner bark was boiled and the tea drunk to reduce fevers and to restore a lost voice. A compound infusion of the bark and the root has been used in the treatment of various childhood diseases such as measles and worms. It was often used in the form of a bath.

  :plant_medicinal_text "Shan Zhu Yu has been used for at least 2,000 years in Chinese herbal medicine. It is a herb that 'stabilizes and binds' and is used principally to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and unusually active secretions including copious sweating, excessive urine, spermatorrhoea and premature ejaculation. Like all herbs that suppress bodily fluids (even excessive ones), it will simply prolong or lead to a worsening of symptoms if it is used without tonic or detoxifying herbs. It is, therefore, normally used in combination with herbs such as Rehmannia glutinosa and is an ingredient of the 'Pill of eight ingredients' which is used in China to 'warm up and invigorate the yang of the loins'. The fruit is antibacterial, antifungal, hypotensive, antitumor, astringent, diuretic, hepatic and tonic. The fruit, without the seed, is decocted for the treatment of arthritis, fever and a wide range of other ailments. It is used in the treatment of senile lumbago, diabetes, cystitis, tinnitus etc. The fruit has an antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of Bacillus dysenteriae and Staphylococcus. The fruit is harvested when fully ripe and is dried for later use. The stem bark is astringent, antimalarial and tonic. The plant is antibacterial, diuretic, hypotensive and a urinary antiseptic."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Red osier dogwood was widely employed by several native North American Indian tribes who valued it especially for its astringent and tonic bark, using it both internally and externally to treat diarrhoea, fevers, skin problems etc. It is little used in modern herbalism. The bark and the root bark are analgesic, astringent, febrifuge, purgative, slightly stimulant and tonic. Drying the bark removes its tendency to purge. A decoction has been used in the treatment of headaches, diarrhoea, coughs, colds and fevers. Externally, the decoction has been used as a wash for sore eyes, styes and other infections and also to treat skin complaints such as poison ivy rash and ulcers. The bark shavings have been applied as a dressing on wounds to stop the bleeding. A poultice of the soaked inner bark, combined with ashes, has been used to alleviate pain. The plant is said to have cured hydrophobia."@en ;

The powdered bark has been used as a toothpowder to preserve the gums and keep the teeth white. An oil obtained from the seed burns well and can be used in lighting. A red dye can be obtained from the bark mixed with cedar ashes. The branches are pliable, they are used as rims in basket making. The stem wood is very tough and flexible. Plants can be grown as a tall ground cover for colonising large areas. The cultivar 'Flaviramea' has been recommended. Red osier is noted as a good Carbon Farming Solution plant. It can be coppiced, used as fodder and act as a living fence. It is a industrial biomass crop."@en .
