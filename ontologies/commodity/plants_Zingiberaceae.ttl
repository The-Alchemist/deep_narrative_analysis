  :plant_edible_text "The rhizomes are widely used in many areas of the world as a flavouring, adding a hot, spicy flavour. They are added to dishes such as cakes, curries, chutneys, stir-fry dishes, candies etc. They are also commonly used in beverages, especially ginger beer. The roots can be used fresh, where a small amount of the grated root is added to the dish, or the root can be dried and ground into a powder, when it will store well for later use. The dried root is about twice as pungent as the fresh root. The very young rhizomes, known as stem ginger, are peeled and eaten raw in salads, pickled, or cooked in syrup and made into sweetmeats. The young, slightly spicy leaves and young shoots can be eaten as a potherb, or pureed and used in sauces and dips. The leaves can also be used to wrap food whilst it is cooked. The young inflorescences can be eaten raw. An essential oil obtained from the root is used in flavouring essences."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Ginger root is widely used in Eastern Herbal treatments - in Ayurveda it is known as the universal medicine and it is an ingredient of about half of all prescriptions in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. The root is rich in volatile oils, gingerols and shogaols. The shogaols are only produced when the root is dried, as a breakdown substance of the gingerols. They are twice as pungent as the gingerols and so the dried root is normally used in different ways to the fresh root. The root is a sweet, pungent, aromatic, warming herb that is expectorant; increases perspiration; improves digestion and liver function; controls nausea, vomiting and coughing; stimulates the circulation; relaxes spasms; and relieves pain. The root is used internally in the treatment of all forms of nausea, including morning and motion sickness. It is used to treat indigestion, colic, abdominal chills, colds, coughs, influenza and peripheral circulatory problems. Externally, the root is used to treat spasmodic pain, rheumatism, lumbago, menstrual cramps and sprains."@en ;
