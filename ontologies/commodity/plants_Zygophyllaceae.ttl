  :plant_hazards "The plant contains saponins. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish."@en ;

  :plant_edible_text "The fleshy pulp of both unripe and ripe fruit is edible and can be eaten dried or fresh. It has a slightly astringent taste and can be purgative in larger quantities. The fruit is processed into a drink and sweetmeats in Ghana, an alcoholic liquor in Nigeria, a soup ingredient in Sudan. The ellipsoid fruit is up to 4cm long. Brown or pale brown when fully ripe, with a brittle coat enclosing a brown or brown-green sticky pulp and a hard stone seed. Young leaves and tender shoots are used as a vegetable. They are prepared by boiling and pounding, and are then fried or mixed with fat. The flowers are a supplementary food in West Africa and a flavouring in Nigeria. They are sucked in order to obtain their nectar. A greenish-yellow to orange-red resin is produced from the stems. It is sucked and chewed when fresh. The kernels produce an edible oil used for cooking. The oil remains stable when heated and has a high smoking point, and therefore its free fatty acid content is low. Its scent and taste are acceptable. The seed contains up to 50% oil."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "It is traditionally used in treatment of various ailments including jaundice, intestinal worm infection, wounds, malaria, syphilis, epilepsy, dysentery, constipation, diarrhea, hemorrhoid, stomach aches, asthma, and fever. It contains protein, lipid, carbohydrate, alkaloid, saponin, flavonoid, and organic acid. The roots are purgative and vermifuge. A decoction of the root is used to treat malaria. The roots are boiled in a soup to be used in the treatment of oedema and stomach pains. They are also used as an emetic. The bark is purgative and vermifuge. An infusion of the bark is used to treat heartburn. The bark is used to deworm cattle in Rajasthan. Wood gum, mixed with maize meal porridge, is used to treat chest pains. The plant is a potential source of steroidal sapogenins (diosgenin) for the hemisynthesis of corticosteroids."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The usually evergreen behaviour potentially makes this plant an attractive element to introduce into shelterbelts, although because of its slow growth, it is not suitable as a principal species. Its thorny habit makes this tree a useful plant for fencing and hedging. Other Uses An oil obtained from the seed has been recommended for the manufacture of soap. A strong fibre is obtained from the bark. A greenish-yellow to orange-red resin is produced from the stems. It is used as a glue for sticking feathers onto arrow shafts and spearheads and in the repair of handle cracks and arrows. The fruit and bark contain saponins. An emulsion made from them is lethal to the freshwater snails that are the host of miracidia and cercaria stages of bilharzia and to a water flea that acts as a host to the guinea worm. The seeds are used for rosary beads and necklaces. The pale yellow or yellowish-brown wood is fine-grained, compact, hard, durable and easily worked. The heartwood and sapwood are not clearly differentiated. It shows no serious seasoning defects and no tendency towards surface checking or splitting. The wood saws cleanly and easily, planes without difficulty to a smooth finish and is easy to chisel. It glues firmly and takes a clear varnish. The timber has traditionally been a minor product, it is made into yokes, wooden spoons, pestles, mortars, handles, stools and combs. The usually small log size and the prevalence of stem fluting makes sawmill processing difficult. The wood is good firewood; it produces considerable heat and very little smoke, making it particularly suitable for indoor use. It produces high-quality charcoal, and it has been suggested that the nutshell is suitable for industrial activated charcoal. The calorific value is estimated at 4600 kcal/kg."@en .

Other Uses: The heartwood is more or less striped and banded, varying in colour from light olive green to chocolate brown. The surface of fresh wood often turns dark green upon exposure. The sapwood is mostly thin and light yellow in colour. The wood is fine textured, cross-grained, with an oily appearance and feel, mildly and pleasantly scented when warmed. Owing to its high density and the resinous nature of the timber, the wood dries slowly and needs careful handling to avoid splitting, it is also prone to ring shake. When seasoned, it is not easy to work either with machine or hand tools but does turn well in the lathe. The heartwood is very durable under exposure and will last indefinitely in the ground. There are reports that posts made from it have lasted for 300 years without rotting. Because of its high density and self-lubrication, the wood has many uses similar to that of Lignum vitae (Guaiacum officinale), but is not considered as suitable for propeller-shaft bushings. It is used as steps and collars for water turbines, mallet heads, pulley wheels, brush backs, locally for railway crossties."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "The resin obtained from the tree is used for flavouring cakes and chewing gum. It is also added to edible oils to prevent acidification."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The wood is officinal in many Pharmacopoeias, and owes its medicinal properties to the presence of the resin, which is also official. Both resin and the wood possess stimulant, diaphoretic, and alterative properties, though the resin has a much stronger action. The resin is also regarded as an emmenagogue. It is a useful remedy in the treatment of chronic forms of rheumatism ; also in syphilitic and gouty affections, scrofula, skin diseases, dysmenorrhoea, and other uterine affections. The resin is applied to the tooth for treating a toothache, and also applied externally to bring relief in cases of rheumatism."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The resin sometimes flows spontaneously from the stem of the tree; at other times, it is obtained artificially by jagging or notching the stem and allowing the exuding juice to harden, or by boring holes in logs of the wood and then placing them on a fire so that the resin is melted and runs through the hole, or by boiling chips in salt and water, when the resin floats on the surface of the water. The deep reddish brown colour of the resin changes upon oxidation to a blue or blue-green, a property made use of for differential staining. The wood is hard, close-grained, tough, dense, and durable. The heart wood is of a dark greenish-brown colour, owing to the deposition of guiacum resin ; the sap wood is pale-yellow. The wood is remarkable for the direction of its fibres, each layer of which crosses the previous diagonally. Its great strength and tenacity, combined with the self-lubricating properties due to the resin content, make this wood especially adapted for bearing underwater. The wood is used for pulleys, blocks, pestles, rulers, skittle ball etc. The most important as well as the most exacting use for it is for bearing or bushing blocks lining the stern tubes of propeller shafts of steamships. Steel and tube mills are made using lignum-vitae in increasing amounts to replace brass and babbit metal for bearings in roller mills and pumps, as the initial cost is less than metal, the life is several times longer, and lubrication is unnecessary."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "Although considered to be less useful than G. Officinale, in practice the wood and resin from this tree are used medicinally in much the same way as that species. In particular, the wood is used as a mild laxative and diuretic. For tonsillitis it is given in powdered form. It is specially useful for treating rheumatoid arthritis, also in cases of chronic rheumatism and gout where it relieves the pain and inflammation between the attacks, and can lessen their recurrence if doses are continued. It acts as an acrid stimulant, increasing the heat of the body and promoting the circulation. When the decoction is taken hot and the body is kept warm, it acts as a diaphoretic, and if cool it works as a diuretic. It is also largely used for treating secondary syphilis, skin diseases and scrofula. The resins obtained from wood, bark, leaves, and flowers are used in some pharmaceutical preparations. The resin obtained from the heartwood is diuretic and mildly laxative."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: A brown to reddish-brown resin is obtained from the heartwood. It is used for making small objects where strength, hardiness and weight are required. The resin contains guaiaconic acid, guaiaretic acid, vanillin and guaiac yellow. It is obtained by boring a log longitudinally then heating it in a sloping position. This causes the resin to melt and flow from the log. The wood can also be chipped and then boiled in water, which causes the resin to float to the surface. The leaves are sometimes used as a substitute for soap. Lignum vitae is one of the heaviest of all woods, sinking under its weight instead of floating in water. The heartwood is a dark greenish brown to almost black, becoming even darker after exposure to air and light. It is readily distinguished from the narrow, pale yellow or cream-coloured sapwood. The wood is extremely hard and heavy; very fine and uniform in texture with a heavily interlocked grain; oily, due to a resin content (guaiac content) that constitutes about 25% of the dry weight; turns and shapes well and takes a high polish; very resistant to attack by decay fungi, termites, and marine borers. Because of the oily resins, the wood requires special surface treatments for satisfactory gluing. It does not require preservation due to its high guaiac resin content and high wood density. The wood is used in bearings, bushing blocks, pulley sheaves, mallet heads, and turnery. It was once popular for use in the manufacture of bowling balls. Its most noted use is in bearings and bushing blocks for the propeller shafts of ships because of its self-lubrication and hardness."@en .

It continued to be widely used as a treatment for rheumatic disease, venereal infections, urinary infections and certain types of cancer, especially leukaemia until its sale was banned in North America due to concern over its potential toxic effect upon the liver. There have been a number of cases of acute or sub-acute hepatitis attributed to the use of this herb and so its internal use is not recommended until further research has been carried out. A tea made from the leaves is used as an expectorant and pulmonary antiseptic. Some N.
