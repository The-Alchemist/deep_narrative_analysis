  :plant_edible_text "Edible portion: Fruit, Seeds, Leaves, Flowers, Vegetable. Breadfruit is a versatile food that can be cooked and eaten at all stages of its development. The fruit can be eaten raw or cooked. The unripe fruit, as small as 2 - 6cm in diameter, is eaten as a starchy vegetable with a flavour similar to that of artichoke hearts. It can be prepared in various ways including boiling, baking, added to soups, pickling etc. Ripe fruits are somewhat sweet and are occasionally eaten raw, but are more often cooked as a starchy vegetable or fermented into a cheese-like food. The mature fruit can be dried and ground into a flour. The mature fruit is about 20cm long. Compared with other staple starch crops, breadfruit is a better source of protein than is cassava; it is comparable to sweet potato and banana. It is a relatively good source of iron, calcium, potassium and riboflavin. Seed - cooked. Firm and close-textured, they are very nutritious, with a flavour somewhat reminiscent of chestnuts. They can be cooked with the raw breadfruit or removed and boiled or roasted. They are usually peeled before being eaten. Both fresh and cooked seeds contain about 8% protein. The seeds are low in fat compared with tree nuts such as almond, brazil nut and macadamia nut, which contain 50 - 70% fat. The seeds are a good source of minerals and contain more niacin than cashews, almonds, macadamia nuts, brazil nuts, pecans, black walnuts or chestnuts. Male inflorescence - cooked and used as a vegetable or used in the preparation of a sweetmeat."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Breadfruit has a very wide range of applications in traditional medicine with all parts of the plant being utilised in the treatment of a range of conditions. Research has shown the presence of a number of active compounds in the plant:- The fruit contains artocarpine and the enzyme papayotine. The leaf contains the phenols quercetin and camphorol, plus gamma-aminobutyric acid, which lowers the blood pressure. The stem-bark and fruit contain cyclopropane sterols. The toasted flowers are rubbed on the gums around aching teeth to ease pain. An extract from the flowers is effective in treating ear oedema. Latex is massaged into the skin to treat broken bones, bruises, sprains, abscesses etc, and is bandaged on the spine to relieve sciatica. It is commonly used to treat puncture wounds in the eyes, skin ailments and fungal diseases such as thrush. The latter is also treated with crushed leaves. Diluted latex is taken internally to treat diarrhoea, stomach-ache and dysentery. Latex and juice from the crushed leaves are both traditionally used to treat ear infections. A filtrate of new, unfolded leaves is employed as a remedy for fish poisoning and as a muscle relaxant in cases of convulsive spasms. The yellowing leaf is brewed into a tea and taken to reduce high blood pressure. The tea is also thought to control diabetes. Hypertension and diabetes medications are prepared from a mixture of the boiled leaves of this species combined with Persea americana, Carica papaya and Annona muricata. The leaves are used in Taiwan to treat liver diseases and fevers. The root is an astringent and is used as a purgative. Pressed fluid of the root is used in the treatment of respiratory ailments which include difficult, painful breathing. When macerated it is used as a poultice for skin ailments. The bark is used to treat headache. Bark extracts exhibited strong cytotoxic activities against leukaemia cells in tissue culture, and extracts from roots and stem barks showed some antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and may have potential in treating tumours. Liquid squeezed from the bark or leaves is given to remedy chest pains and vomiting resulting from heart trouble. Pressed liquid from the stem bark is employed in the treatment of pain in the bones and maternal postpartum infections. The bark is also used to treat stomach aches and digestive tract problems. Fluid pressed from young fruit is given to treat an illness which causes pain in the lungs and vomiting of blood."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Seaside; shade tree, backyard tree, specimen. Agroforestry Uses: The breadfruit is an important component of traditional agroforestry systems in the Pacific Islands. The trees are integrated into mixed cropping systems with yams and other root crops, Piper methysticum, bananas and some cash crops, especially black pepper and coffee. The tree is sometimes used as a wind-break or shade tree for coffee plantations. Other Uses The male flower spikes are blended with fibre of paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) to make elegant loincloths. The inner layer of bark, or bast, was used to make bark cloth (tapa). Traditionally it had ceremonial and ritual uses, was also used for beddings and items of clothing such as cloaks, loincloths and robes. Breadfruit bast makes good cordage with a diverse range of uses such as harnesses for water buffalo and nets for catching sharks. The sticky, milky sap is a gum that is used to caulk canoes to make them watertight and can be used as an adhesive to seal and prepare wooden surfaces for painting. A sticky latex is present in all parts of the tree and has many uses. It is used as a chewing gum in the Caribbean and elsewhere. Can be used as an adhesive for bark cloth and for caulking canoes. The latex can be mixed with coconut oil for trapping houseflies. The inflorescence has been used to make a yellow tan to brown dye. The fat extracted from the seed is a light yellow liquid, viscous at room temperature, with a characteristic odour similar to that of peanuts. It has a chemical number and physical properties similar to those of olive oil. The dried, hard flowers can be burned as a mosquito repellent. The leaves are widely used as plates and also to wrap food for cooking and serving. The dried stipules or senescent leaves are slightly rough, and in Hawaii they were used to polish and smooth bowls and nuts strung for decorative purposes. The heartwood is golden speckled with orange, differentiated from the yellow or brownish-yellow sapwood. The golden yellow colour darkens with age. The wood is very light, durable, soft, but quite resistant in spite of its low specific gravity. Traditionally it was widely used for the construction of houses and canoes because of its resistance to termites and marine worms. The wood is also used to make bowls, carvings, furniture and even surfboards. The trees are an important source of firewood in some areas."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "Edible portion: Fruit, Seeds, Leaves, Flowers. Fruit - raw or cooked in a variety of ways. The pulp of young fruit is rich in carbohydrates and is usually cooked as a vegetable. The fruit becomes sweeter as it ripens, as some of the carbohydrates are converted into sugars. It is often eaten raw at this stage, but is also still cooked as a vegetable. The rind of the fruit yields a fair jelly. The fruit case is enormous, it can be 30 - 50cm long, weigh up to 20kg and contain up to 500 individual golden-coloured fruits. They have rather a strong smell which some people do not like, though they can be dried when the smell is less. Seed - cooked. Lovely when boiled or roasted, with a flavour and texture similar to chestnuts. They can be ground into a powder and used in making biscuits. The seeds have a high starch content and about 5% protein. When boiling the seeds, the water is sometimes changed 2 or three times in order to remove an objectionable odour. Very young fruits and leaf shoots - cooked in soups and stews. Young male flowers are eaten mixed with chillies, sugar, salt etc. There can be 100-500 seed in a fruit. Unlike breadfruit, there are no seedless Jackfruit. When ripe the unopened fruit has a strong smell."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The ashes of leaves, with or without oil, are used to treat ulcers, diarrhoea, boils, stomach-ache and wounds. The pulp and seeds of the fruit are regarded as a cooling tonic. The seeds are said to be an aphrodisiac. The sap is an anti-syphilitic and a vermifuge. The wood is claimed to have sedative properties, and its pith is said to be able to induce abortion. A root decoction is used to alleviate fever, treat diarrhoea, skin diseases and asthma. The bacteriolytic activity of the latex is equal to that of papaya latex. Dried latex yields artotenone, a compound with marked androgenic action; it can also be mixed with vinegar to promote healing of abscesses, snakebite and glandular swellings."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Suitable for growing indoors. Agroforestry Uses: The tree has a wide-ranging root system and can be planted to control floods and soil erosion in farms. It is suitable for use in reforestation projects. The tree is often used in mixed plantings. It can be used as a shade tree for coffee, planted with coconut groves, has been used as an intercrop in durian orchards, and with mango and citrus. Young jackfruit orchards may be intercropped with annual cash crops such as banana, sweet corn and groundnut. Other Uses The inner part of the bark or bast is occasionally made into cordage or cloth. The latex obtained from the trunk and branches yields 71.8% resin, consisting of 63.3% fluavilles (yellow) and 8.5% albanes (white). These resins may be valuable in varnishes. The latex is commonly used as adhesive for mending broken chinaware or earthenware, caulking boats, mending holes of buckets and trapping birds. In India and Brazil, the latex serves as a substitute for rubber. The bark yields a dark, water-soluble resinous gum that contains 3.3% tannin. When boiled with alum, the sawdust or chips of the heartwood produce a rich yellow dye used for silk and the cotton robes of Buddhist priests. Wood is yellow at first, becoming red. It is classified as medium hardwood. It is resistant to termite attack and fungal and bacterial decay and is easy to season. It takes polish beautifully. Though not as strong as teak, it is considered superior to that wood for furniture, construction, turnery and inlay work, masts, oars, implements and musical instruments. The wood is widely used in India and Sri Lanka and is even exported to Europe. Roots are highly prized for carvings and picture framing. The wood is used for fuel."@en .

The tree is slow in forming heartwood, which is the only part used commercially. A tree of 35cm diameter may, on occasions, have only 2 - 10cm of heartwood, while a 50cm tree will ordinarily have not more than 18cm. The amount of heartwood is reported to vary according to location. Certain areas produce timber with considerable heartwood, while in other areas even large trees may not be worth felling The heartwood is dark red to reddish brown or brown, with black markings that resemble letters or hieroglyphs - the distinctiveness of these markings is reduced as the colour of the backgrounds is darkened by exposure; it is not clearly demarcated from the light, yellow to nearly white sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain straight; lustre medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The wood is extremely hard, extremely heavy, strong, very durable, resistant to dry wood termites. Because of its hardness, the wood is worked with considerable difficulty, being difficult to cut and taking nails poorly, however it finishes smoothly and takes a beautiful polish. Because of the limited supply, small size, and high cost, the wood is best suited for specialty items that capitalize on its unusual beauty, hardness, and density. It is therefore mainly used for purposes such as inlay work, furniture, drum sticks, umbrella handles, fishing rods, fancy articles, violin bows, cabinet work etc."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "A latex is obtained from the bark of the stem and larger branches. This can be used for all applications of natural rubber, such as tyres, rubber components for cars and machines and consumer products such as footwear, sport goods, toys and gloves. Traditionally, the latex is used to line baskets of split rattan, to make them watertight, and has sundry other applications. The rubber made from this plant contains 4 - 20% resin, which hardens over time and decreases the rubber's elasticity. The rubber has relatively short chains of polyisoprenes of low molecular weight: 78 000. It is soluble in cajeput oil (Melaleuca cajuputi Powell). The rubber is hypoallergenic to individuals allergic to the proteins found in Hevea brasiliensis rubber products. The latex of wild as well as planted trees can be collected by tapping the bark, generally only of the stem and larger branches, though root bark may also be tapped. It is best to harvest when the air humidity is high, as drier conditions cause the latex to coagulate too fast and rain reduces the rubber content of the exudate. Traditionally the bark was cut with a knife or small axe, later incisions were made with a gouge to better control the depth of cutting and to limit the wounding of the cambium. In the bark the laticifers are found closest to the cambium in a fibrous tissue which is difficult to cut. If the incision is not deep enough, the tissue containing most laticifers is not tapped and yield is low. A deep incision damages the cambium and hence influences the vitality of the tree. A V-shaped gouge can also be used to make horizontal incisions up to 5 cm wide and some 20 cm long, the length never exceeding half the circumference of the tree. These cuts are about 40 cm apart and on opposite sides of the tree. A herringbone system has also been applied, in which a central vertical channel transports the latex from grooves made at an angle of 45? with the vertical to a container driven into the bark of the tree. Inside the inclined grooves the fibres are punctured or cut at intervals of 2- 3 cm, to tap the laticifers closest to the cambium. This, however, also punctures or cuts the cambium layer. An advantage of the herringbone system is that the latex is collected as a fluid and is of better quality than the 'scrap' collected from the horizontal incisions or from underneath the tree. The latex drips from the horizontal incisions for about 2 - 3 minutes and is collected on a mat or on leaves placed underneath the tree. The coagulated latex is collected 2 - 3 days later; when stripped off the incision a milky residue oozes from the wound, but this liquid contains no rubber. A well-developed planted tree can be tapped after 6 - 7 years, but with increasing age (and circumference of the tree) when the first tapping is done, both yield as well as rubber content of the latex increase. There has been much debate and experimenting on the frequency of tapping. In this respect it is important that the latex extracted is not replaced and that there is no anastomosis between the laticifers, so only the latex from the immediate vicinity of the tapping wound exudes. This is why consecutive tappings, whether every day or once a year for three years, have shown a marked decrease in yield. Yields in g/tree from a tapping trial with 55 trees in Bogor for four harvests at intervals of 2, 3 , and 4 years were 238 g, 67 g, 70 g and 320 g. This suggests that it takes four years before the laticifers are reconstituted. Provided the tree will survive, it is therefore more rational to extract the maximum amount of latex at once, rather than tapping trees several times over a period of few years The 'scrap' from Ficus elastica is sorted by hand and cleaned. The latex is difficult to coagulate: neither heating nor adding organic or mineral acids, even concentrated sulphuric acid, or alkali, will cause it to coagulate. Instead, it must be beaten and kneaded, and alcohol must be added. This yields a superior product which does not become sticky with time. Ammonia and tannin have been used as coagulants in Peninsular Malaysia. The 'scrap' and the coagulated latex are pressed into blocks, cakes or sheets before being traded. The latex showed toxicity to the juveniles of the nematode Meloidogyne javanica. The fibrous bark has been used for the manufacture of clothes and ropes. The wood is of poor quality, but is occasionally applied for boards, posts, boats and fuel."@en .

It is also used in mixtures of dyes with other plants. It is an ingredient of the traditional 'soga-batik', together with the bark of Ceriops tagal and Peltophorum pterocarpum. Sometimes the dye is used for colouring other materials like mattings. In the traditional 'soga-batik' process the wood is chopped into small pieces (3 - 5 cm), and mixed with the chopped bark of Ceriops tagal and Peltophorum pterocarpum, usually in the ratio of 1:2:4, but other proportions are also used, depending on the desired colour. The mixture is put into a pan, covered with water, and boiled until it has thickened to the right consistency; this usually takes about 8 hours. After cooling, filtering, and about 2 hours of precipitation, the liquid is transferred to another pan and used for dyeing cotton textiles. For this purpose the textile, partly covered by wax where colouring is not wanted, is soaked in the warm to cool (but not hot) infusion until absorption is even. Then, the textile is dried in a shady place. This process of soaking and drying is repeated at least 20 times for good quality 'soga-batik'."@en .

Two phenolic compounds (chlorophorin and iroko) have shown in-vitro anti-amoebic activity. A methanol extract of the stem bark has shown in-vivo anti-inflammatory properties. A root decoction is taken to treat female sterility. A decoction of the root and stem bark is taken as an aphrodisiac. The bark is aphrodisiac, galactagogue, purgative and tonic. It is used to treat a wide range of conditions including cough, asthma, heart trouble, lumbago, spleen pain, stomach pain, abdominal pain, oedema, ascites, dysmenorrhoea, gonorrhoea, general fatigue, rheumatism, sprains. Bark preparations are externally applied to treat scabies, wounds, loss of hair, fever, venereal diseases and sprains. They are also applied as an enema to cure piles, diarrhoea and dysentery. The latex is considered to be galactagogue. It is taken in the treatment of stomach problems, hypertension, tumours and obstructions of the throat. Externally, it is applied on burns, wounds, sores and against eczema and other skin problems. The leaves are galactagogue.

The grain is interlocked; texture medium to coarse; figure mottled. The wood is somewhat greasy and is odourless. The wood is of medium weight, moderately hard, of good durability, being resistent to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. Working properties for hand and machine tools are generally good but variable; the interlocked grain may hamper sawing and planing. The wood is rather abrasive due to the presence of hard deposits (‘iroko stones’, mainly consisting of calcium carbonate), which can blunt cutting edges. Tearing in planing can be avoided by using cutting angles of 15° or less. The wood has good nailing, screwing, mortising and gluing properties and turns easily. It finishes well, but filler is needed. The wood contains the stilbene derivative chlorophorin, which prevents oil-based paints from drying, and which corrodes metal in contact with it. Steam-bending properties of the wood are moderate. The wood is a highly valued commercial timber in Africa, for which demand is large. It is used for construction work, shipbuilding and marine carpentry, sleepers, sluice gates, framework, trucks, draining boards, outdoor and indoor joinery, stairs, doors, frames, garden furniture, cabinet work, panelling, flooring and profile boards for decorative and structural uses. It is also used for carving, domestic utensils, musical instruments and toys. As it is resistant to acids and bases, it is used for tanks and barrels for food and chemical products and for laboratory benches. It is used as sliced veneer but only rarely as rotary veneer.
