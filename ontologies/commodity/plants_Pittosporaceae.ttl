  :plant_habitat "Not very abundant in any part of the Philippines, but it is widely distributed and usually found on high mountain ridges. Found in mossy forests at elevations from 600 - 2,400 metres. Found among other trees like oak and other mossy forest species. It can also grow well with pine trees."@en ;

  :plant_physical_characteristics "Pittosporum Resiniferum is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  It is hardy to zone (UK) 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Herbalists in the Philippines use the petroleum nut as a universal medicine. An infusion of the fruit is used as a remedy for intestinal and stomach pains. An oleoresin obtained from the fruit is used externally as a cure for leprosy and other skin diseases; also to bring relief from muscular pains and skin diseases. A decoction of the nuts is used in the treatment of colds. The crushed nuts, combined with coconut oil, are used to bring relief from myalgia. A decoction of the leaves is taken in the treatment of coughs. The sap is used to treat ringworm."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "An oil obtained from the fruit contains a dihydroterpene and also considerable quantities of normal heptane, which had only once before been found in nature, occurring in the digger pine (Pinus sabiniana) of California. The oil can also be distilled into a very pure form of n-Heptane. Dihydroterpene is used in perfumes and medicines, whilst heptane is a component of gasoline, and has been suggested as a possible component of paint and varnish. The oil is quite sticky, and in a thin layer rapidly becomes resinous. In an open dish it burns strongly, with a sooty flame. It distils unchanged up to 165°, then with decomposition to give a resin oil. The oil distilling from100° to 165° is colourless, with an orange-like odour. The essential oil is 8 - 10% of the total fruit weight and comprises 40% myrcene, 38% a-pinene, n-heptane and n-nonane are minor components. The fruits, even green ones, burn brilliantly when ignited. Hence they are used like torch nuts or candlenuts for illumination in the bush. The fruits are about 3cm long, borne in clusters on the stems. The oil comes from the fruit, not the seed. The nut has a carbon rating of 54, much higher than Jatropha curcas which has 41. Carbon farming - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon."@en .
