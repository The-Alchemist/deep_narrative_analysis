It contains 22% uronic acid. It is of good viscosity and is usable as a substitute for or adulterant of gum-arabic. A cold water infusion of the gum is considered a palatable beverage. A decoction is given to a new-born baby to drink. The fruit and the calyx are used in the preparation of sauces or to make a tea. Tender young leaves - cooked and eaten as a vegetable."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark, leaves and roots are all used in traditional medicine usually in the form of decoctions. They have antimicrobial and anthelmintic activity and are usually taken as decoctions. Extracts of the stem and root bark and of the leaves have shown antifungal activity against a number of pathogenic fungi. Moderate antibacterial activity of the bark was also demonstrated. Extracts of the plant have exhibited in-vitro activity against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. A decoction of the leaves or leafy twigs is used against yellow fever, jaundice, different kinds of hepatitis, common cold and headache. Externally, a leaf decoction is applied against haemorrhoids and skin diseases. The root-bark is considered to be aphrodisiac and stimulant. In some regions the bark is used as a febrifuge in hot lotions and infusions. The powdered bark and a bark decoction are used externally to treat wounds, eczema, psoriasis, anthrax, carbuncles, boils and several kinds of ulcers. The bark decoction is also known as a muscular tonic. The bark and the exuding gum have been shown to prevent and cure dental caries and toothache and are commonly used in Africa. The gum obtained from the bark is laxative. It can be used in pharmacy as an emulsifying agent. The bark itself is chewed to obtain the gum. The fleshy roots are used against labour pains. The pulped roots are applied to sores to promote healing, and to accelerate wound healing. The seeds have a wide bactericidal and fungicidal activity in humans and animals."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: The tree is planted in Eritrea to stabilize river banks. Within its native range it is a pioneer species on open forest clearings. However, the tree has very slow initial growth and is very sensitive to bush fires, which somewhat limit its usefulness. When grown gregariously it effecively kills out grass. Other Uses The leaves are rich in tannins and are used to dye cloth a yellow colour. In West Africa, they are commonly used in the oldest African traditional dyeing process of cotton textiles known as 'basilan'. Dyeing with the leaves of this plant has even become a full-time occupation for many people. The bark, and roots are also a source of tannins and dyes. The ash of the leaves, the bark and the wood are used as mordants to improve the fastness of many other dyes and in the indigo dyeing process to maintain the necessary alkaline pH. The wood ash is used as a lye in washing clothes and as a basis for making soap. The damaged bark exudes a partially soluble gum which contains 22% uronic acid. It is of good viscosity and can be used as a substitute for or adulterant of gum-arabic (Senegalia species). It is used in various ways, including for beating cloth; to make ink more viscous; as an adhesive; medicinally; and for food. In Ghana and Nigeria the roots are used and traded as chewing sticks. The chewing sticks have shown strong activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria, including some contributing to tooth-deterioration. The heartwood is a dark, dull brown, streaky, becoming almost ebony-black; it is distinctly demarcated from the wide band of whitish yellow sapwood. The texture is fine; the grain wavy or interlocked. The wood is heavy and hard; it is not durable in contact with the soil, but is resistant to the attacks of termites and insects, though not of marine borers. It is extremely resistant to preservatives. It seasons rapidly, but with some distortion. The wood is moderately easy to saw, but difficult to plane, mortise and bore; it finishes and polishes well and is easy to turn and glue, but nailing is difficult. It is much used for piles and rafters in house construction, for agricultural implements, tool handles and occasionally in cabinet making. It is a favoured wood for use in carving. The wood is an excellent fuel and yields good charcoal. In the whole Sahel region fuel has become so scarce that even these useful trees are being sacrificed."@en .

In tests the wood ash has shown good results in managing cowpea weevils in stored cowpea seeds. The bark is a source of tannins. The heartwood is dark brown; it is distinctly demarcated from the thin layer of yellow-brown sapwood. The grain is straight, texture fine. The wood is very heavy and extremely durable, even in contact with the ground, and is very termite resistant. It is difficult to work, rapidly blunting cutting edges, but it takes a very nice lustrous polish. The turning properties are excellent. The wood is used for fence poles, mine props, railway sleepers, mortars, walking sticks, inlay work, toys and turnery. Because of its durability, it is commonly used for the main supporting poles of huts. It is popular for sculpture and lathe work, whereas it is also used to make heavy, extremely durable furniture. The wood is favoured for use as a fuel and for charcoal production; it burns slowly and with great heat."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "The leaves have a high reputation as a 'cure-all' in Africa, where they are used in the treatment of a wide range of conditions. They are most commonly taken in decoctions or are mixed with foods. The bitter tasting leaves are antitussive, appetizer, blood purifier, diuretic, febrifuge, galactagogue, laxative, pectoral and tonic. They are used to treat a wide range of conditions such as: pulmonary and respiratory complaints, including coughs and fevers; digestive tract problems including colic, dysentery and diarrhoea; infectious diseases including syphilis, beriberi and leprosy; and various other conditions such as impotence, rheumatism and oedema. The powdered leaves are mixed with food as a general tonic and blood restorative after any exhausting condition, and especially given to women after childbirth to promote the flow of milk. The leaves are commonly made into an infusion, combined with those of Combretum micranthum, for treating fever, chest and rheumatic conditions, and as a nasal douche for cold in the head. The plant has a special reputation as a preventive of leprosy and many people drink a cold decoction of the leaves every morning and evening; in particular it is given to the newborn child, and to the child of a leper parent, or when there is the least suspicion of hereditary taint or early symptoms. The dried leaves are smoked in a pipe and the smoke is blown through the nose as a remedy for colds. They are mixed with tobacco for smoking as a treatment for coughs and respiratory trouble. The powdered leaves are added to a snuff taken for headache and sinusitis. The leaves are applied externally to bring healing to the body - they are considered antiseptic and vulnerary. They are applied to wounds, sores in the mouth, syphilitic chancres and phagadenic ulcers. The leaves are applied to skin infections and in poultices on inflammatory swellings and for guinea-worm; they have been applied to tumours to maturate them and as a treatment for skin-diseases. A leaf-decoction is used as a body-wash and for bathing new-born babies. The fruit and leaves are common ingredients in more or less ceremonial prescriptions for strengthening and preventing disease in young children. The twigs are chewed for symptomatic relief of scorpion stings. The powdered and boiled roots are considered a remedy for diarrhoea and dysentery. The fruits, baked and reduced to a powder with salt added to mask the bitter taste, are considered a sovereign cure for hiccups. Leafy stems have been found to contain traces of alkaloids and tannins. Ash of the roots and leaves appear to be particularly rich in magnesium, calcium, strontium, titanium, iron and aluminium. Pharmacologically the plant has positive action on coughs, is hypotensive, antidiarrhetic and anti-inflammatory."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A typical pioneer species, the seed is spread by grazing animals and the plant grows especially well where the soil has become impoverished. It is capable of colonizing tracts of land, which might otherwise be bare, to form pure stands. Restriction of the plant's spread is recommended in Senegal to improve the quality of Sahel pasturage. The plant is often found growing on very poor and degraded land - it is seen as an indicator of overgrazed land. Other Uses: The bark yields a gum which is marketed. The thin branches are used for plaiting work when making baskets, for mats that are used for sand stabilization, and for fencing material. The roots are commonly split and used as chew-sticks and tooth-picks. The smoke from burning branches repels flies. The wood is whitish or tinged red, coarse-grained, knotted and short, but very hard. It used for the framework of wells, bed-posts, etc. The shrub is commonly cut to fence farms. The branches, and particularly the roots, are considered to be a good fuel."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "Black myrobalan is of central importance to Ayurvedic medicine. It has long been considered a prime remedy for all manner of digestive problems and is sacred to Siva. The medicinal properties have been tested in numerous experiments. The fruits contain a range of medically active constituents including anthraquinones, tannins, chebulic acid, resin and a fixed oil. Fruit extracts exhibited significant inhibitory activity on oxidative stress and age-dependent shortening of the telomeric DNA length, and thus an inhibitory effect on cellular aging. They also have shown cardioprotective effect. A crude extract of the fruits inhibited cancer cell growth, with chebulinic acid, tannic acid and ellagic acid as the most inhibitory phenolics. Antidiabetic effects of the fruit extract have been demonstrated. The fruits showed antiviral activities. Gallic acid and 3 galloyl glucoses were isolated as inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase. Extracts inhibited replication of human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and may be beneficial for the prophylaxis of CMV disease in immuno-compromised patients. They also showed activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Antibacterial activities have been demonstrated. An extract of the fruit inhibited glycolysis of salivary bacteria and may serve as an anticaries agent. Topical administration of a leaf extract accelerated the healing process of wounds, partly by possessing antimicrobial activity Black myrobalan is a sweet, astringent, warming herb with an unpleasant taste. They have numerous medicinal properties: laxative, stomachic, expectorant, haemostatic, tonic, and alterative. They show antibacterial and antifungal activity, and are used to cure inflamed gums and as a relief in asthma. The fruits are used internally in the treatment of constipation, digestive and nervous complaints, diarrhoea, dysentery, intestinal worms, haemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, abnormal uterine bleeding and inflammation, vaginal discharge, involuntary ejaculation, coughs and asthma. Externally, it is used to treat ulcers, wounds, mouth inflammation and gum disease. The fruit is harvested when ripe and sun-dried for later use. The sour fruits are a major ingredient of 'triphala', a rejuvenative, laxative tonic based on this species plus the fruits of Phyllanthus emblica and Terminalia belerica.

The fruits are also used in calico dyeing and printing, both as auxiliaries and as dyes; their tannins act as mordants to fix the dyes onto the cotton cloth and the unctuous consistence of the pulp makes the surface of the cloth suitably smooth to receive fine printed or painted designs. A yellow dye can be prepared from the fruits plus alum; a black dye and ink can be prepared from the fruits plus iron. Myrobalans are also used as a mordant for the basic aniline dyes. The dried fruit-pulp has an average tannin content of 30 - 32%, but the content varies considerably with the place of origin. Poor samples may register less than 20% tannin, good ones over 40%. Other parts of the plant such as roots, bark, wood and leaves, also contain tannin, but less than the fruits. Astringent galls often form on young twigs. These are rich in tannins and are used to make dyes and ink. The flowers give a yellow dye, used for painting yellow and green details on calicos A transparent oil is obtained from the seed. The heartwood is usually quite small, it is dark brown to reddish-brown; it is sharply differentiated from the spawood, which is yellowish-grey to grey, sometimes with a greenish tinge. Texture is medium to fine; the grain interlocked, sometimes curly. The wood is very hard; heavy to very heavy; strong and tough; not durable unless under cover. It is very difficult to saw, to season and to work. It is used as construction timber and for furniture, carts and implements. It is not of much value according to some reports, whilst another says that it is of good quality."@en .

A pioneer species, it is a good colonizer of abandoned farmlands. Other Uses A yellow dye can be obtained from the wood, and more especially from the bark. Reddish brown and black dyes can also be obtained if iron-rich mud or iron salts are used as a mordant. It is used for dyeing cloth and fibres for basket-work, hammocks, etc. The heartwood is yellowish brown to pale pinkish brown; it is not clearly demarcated from the slightly paler, 2 - 5cm wide band of sapwood. The grain is usually straight, sometimes slightly interlocked; texture is moderately coarse; lustre moderate; the wood is sometimes irregularly brown striped. The wood is very light to moderately heavy; soft to moderately hard; fairly strong; fairly durable and fairly resistant to fungi, although it may be attacked by pin-hole borers, powder-post beetles, longhorn beetles and termites. It air dries well and rapidly, with little degrade, provided there is good air circulation. The rates of shrinkage are moderate. The wood is easy to saw and work with both hand and machine tools; blunting effect on cutting edges is slight; quarter-sawn wood may tear slightly in planing operations; it finishes well when a filler is used; stains, polishes and turns well; has good nailing and screwing properties; glues satisfactorily, although gluing must be done with care because the exudates from the wood are acidic. It contains yellowish tannins, which may cause staining under humid conditions and in contact with iron. The steam-bending properties are poor. A useful timber species with a yellow-brown heartwood that is similar to oak, it is a good general purpose timber that is valued for light construction, door and window frames, joinery, fine carpentry, furniture, cabinet work, veneer and plywood. It is suitable for flooring, interior trim, vehicle bodies, sporting goods, boxes, crates, matches, turnery, hardboard, particle board and pulpwood. It is used locally for house construction, planks, fencing posts, dug-out canoes, drums and mortars. The wood splits easily and is much used in Ghana for roof-shingles which are said to have a life of 15 - 20 years. The wood is used for fuel and is highly valued for making charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Terminalia superba is classified as a pioneer species and usually regenerates well after forest exploitation. Seedlings are often abundant along roadsides and in medium-sized forest gaps. Seedlings are tolerant of full exposure to the sun and so can be used in the initial stages of reforestation projects. The tree is occasionally used as a shade tree in banana, cocoa and coffee plantations. Other Uses A yellow dye is obtained from the bark. Reddish brown and black dyes can also be obtained if iron-rich mud or iron salts are used as a mordant. It can be used to dye wraps, matting and basket fibres. The wood is quite variable and three types of commercial timber are recognised from this tree:- white or straw coloured; black, olive-grey to blackish-brown; and multicoloured, with dark and light streaks. The heartwood is not clearly demarcated from the 12 - 15cm wide band of sapwood. After exposure to the air, it darkens slightly, verging on a tanned appearance, and resembling a light oak. The wood is light to medium weight; soft to moderately hard; somewhat weak; not durable, being liable to attacks by pin-hole borers, powder-post beetles, longhorn beetles, termites and marine borers. It air dries rapidly with little degrade; rates of shrinkage are moderate; once dry, the wood is stable in service. The wood is easy to saw and work with both hand and machine tools; the blunting effect on cutting edges is slight; it finishes well, but the use of a filler is necessary; it holds nails and screws well, but has some tendency to splitting; gluing is satisfactory; it accepts paints and varnish well. The wood can be made into good-quality veneer by slicing as well as rotary peeling. The steam-bending properties are poor. The wood is valued for interior joinery, door posts and panels, mouldings, furniture, office-fittings, crates, matches, and particularly for veneer and plywood. It is suitable for light construction, light flooring, ship building, interior trim, vehicle bodies, sporting goods, toys, novelties, musical instruments, food containers, vats, turnery, hardboard, particle board and pulpwood. It is used locally for temporary house construction, planks, roof shingles, canoes, paddles, coffins, boxes and domestic utensils. It is suitable for paper making, although the paper is of moderate quality. The wood has potential importance in paper making, offering the capability of producing a relatively wide range of pulps. The wood is used for fuel and for making charcoal."@en .
