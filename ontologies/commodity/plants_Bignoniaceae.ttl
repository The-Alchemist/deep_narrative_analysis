A fruit cut in half makes two small cups, one of which is carried by almost every Indian pedestrian, often attached to his waist, as a drinking cup. There is said to be in Guatemala a form of this tree that bears exceptionally small fruits, little larger than a hen's egg - these small fruits are often used to fashion spinning tops for children. A decoction of the leaves is said to promote the growth of hair. The wood is used locally for making wagons and other articles."@en .

A syrup and a popular confection called 'carabobo' is made from the seed. To make the syrup, the seeds are ground finely, mixed with sugar and a little water then boiled. The roasted seeds, combined with roasted wheat, are used as an aromatic and flavourful coffee substitute. The leaves are sometimes cooked in soups."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The pulp (of the fruit?) is astringent, emollient, expectorant and laxative. It is used in domestic medicines. The fruit is abortifacient, emetic, emmenagogue, purgative and vermifuge. A syrup made from the pulp of the fruit is a popular remedy for colds. The juice of the fruit is used to treat diarrhoea, pneumonia and intestinal irregularity. It is made into a strong tea and drunk to procure an abortion, to ease childbirth, and is used in a mix to relieve severe menstrual pains by eliminating blood clots. A syrup made from the fruit is used to treat consumption. The leaves are cholagogue, emetic (in larger doses), and purgative. An infusion is sometimes administered for treating dysentery. It is boiled with sugar, soft grease or Buckley's white rub to make a syrup that is used to treat colds. Juice of young leaves is drunk to remedy colds and lung diseases. The leaf is chewed to treat toothache The leaves are used as a wash to cleanse dirty wounds. The whole plant is used as a diuretic against hydropsy and diarrhoea. The ripe fruit-pulp contains crescentic, tartaric, citric, tannic, chlorogenic and hydrocyanic acids, and may cause abortion in cattle. The seed oil contains oleic acid. The stem-bark and leaf show antimicrobial activity"@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Specimen, Curiosity, Support for epiphytes, Botanic collection, Latge conservatory, Xerophytic. Other Uses The plant produces subglobose hard-shelled fruits about 15 - 30cm long. Local people constrict the growth of these fruits by tying strings around them and, by so doing, fashion them into a variety of shapes. These can then be used as rattles, bowls, cups, containers etc, in much the same way as bottle gourds are used. The most general use of the shells is for making drinking vessels, but the larger ones serve to store all sorts of articles. Sections of the oblong forms are much used in place of spoons. Many of the jicaras, as the cups made from the shells are called, are handsomely decorated in colours or by incised designs. The hard, smooth shells polish well and are finely carved for ritual use in some parts of Africa. The wood is light brown or yellowish brown, with fine veining of darker colour, without distinctive taste or odour; moderately hard and heavy, tough and strong, coarse-textured, fairly easy to work, takes a smooth finish; but is probably not durable. It is used for ox yokes, tool handles, and vehicle parts and is sometimes used in construction. Thick crooked limbs often are used in Guatemala for making saddle trees. The wood has been used from Colonial times to the present to make stirrups - some of those of the colonial period are beautifully carved and are real objects of art. The wood is easy to carve when still green but when thoroughly seasoned is 'like iron' and some have perhaps been in use for 'hundreds' of years. The wood is also used for fuel."@en .

The appearance is frequently oily; yellow-green deposits of lapachol are abundant; the lustre is low to medium; the grain typically interlocked producing a fine, stripe figure on quarter-sawn surfaces; the texture is fine to medium, moderately uniform. The wood is hard, dense, durable, resistant to insect attack, resilient and highly resistant to shock. It is reported to be rather difficult to work and inclined to splinter, but it finishes very smoothly, turns well and polishes nicely. It is difficult to glue and pre-boring is necessary before nailing. The wood is highly esteemed where available, and is considered excellent for construction purposes, especially where durability is important. It is also used for boats, tool handles etc. The Cathedral of Panama Vieja contained beams of this wood, and these were reported to be perfectly sound after having been exposed to the weather since the destruction of the city some 250 years previously."@en .

The heartwood contains a naphthaquinone called lapachol - this has been shown to have antibiotic and antitumor effects. Many native S. American peoples have prized pau d'arco as a cure-all, using it to treat a wide range of conditions including wounds, fevers, dysentery, intestinal inflammation and snake bites. In modern herbalism the bark is used internally in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, chronic degenerative diseases, cancers, tumours, cysts, fungal infections (especially candidiasis), venereal diseases, rheumatic diseases, skin problems (especially eczema, herpes and scabies). It is also used, in combination with other herbs, to clear toxins, resolve congestion and strengthen the immune system. The wood is harvested as required and dried for later use."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The heartwood is greenish to yellowish-brown; the sapwood is yellowish. The texture is medium; the grain interlocked; lustre is medium. The wood is very heavy, durable, especially when not in contact with the soil. It can be very hard to cut, but works well and gives a good finish. The timber, known as lapacho, is highly valued for cabinet making. It is also used for railway ties, telegraph poles, interior finishes, parquet flooring, sports items such as wooded balls, musical instruments etc. Most species of Handroanthus, almost certainly including this one, produce a very hard, heavy and durable timber known as Ipe. The general description of Ipe wood is as follows:- The heartwood is yellowish brown to dark olive brown, sometimes with thin veins; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 9cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is usually fine, though it is medium in some species; the grain is interlocked; there are canals in the wood containing a greenish-yellow deposit of lapachol. The wood is very heavy; very hard; elastic; it is very durable, even in contact with the soil, resisting fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons slowly, but with only a low risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect - stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; there can be some difficulties due to the interlocked grain; filling is recommended in order to get a good finish; nailing and screwing are good , but require pre-boring; gluing is correct for internal use only, and needs to be done with care because the wood is so dense. A very durable and strong wood, it has a very wide range of uses, especially for outdoor applications. It is used for making high class furniture, cabinet work, heavy construction, railway sleepers, bridges, hydraulic works, industrial flooring, posts and poles, turnery, musical instruments, tool handles, veneer etc."@en .

It is used as a treatment against fever, snake poison and manchineel poison. The dried bark of the trunk is grated and applied as a plaster as a remedy for leishmaniasis. The plaster is changed daily until the ulcer is cicatrized. The wood is used in a decoction as a sudorific to treat fevers. The flowers are pectoral. The corolla of the flowers is used in a decoction, mixed with sugar, as a syrup to remedy rheumatism, coughing and grippe. The plant contains lapachol, a naphthoquinone which has been shown to have antitumor activity."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The heartwood of freshly cut wood is yellowish-green; becoming light to dark olive-brown, often with lighter or darker streaks as it dries; it is clearly demarcated from the 12 - 88mm wide, cream-coloured sapwood that dries to white or greyish-white. The grain is straight to very irregular; texture is fine; lustre low to medium. The wood is very hard, extremely heavy, strong and very durable when in contact with the ground, though it is susceptible to marine-borer attack. It is moderately difficult to work, especially with hand tools where it has a blunting effect on cutting edges. Flat-sawed material planes to a good finish but reduction of the cutting angle to at least 15 degrees is recommended to eliminate chipping of quartersawn stock. The wood finishes satisfactorily in other operations except for some difficulty encountered when interlocked grain is present. The timber stains and polishes well and requires little grain-filler. Pre-boring is required before nailing to prevent splitting and the bending of nails. The wood is particularly well adapted for uses which take advantage of its strength, toughness, resilience, and very high resistance to insects and decay. It is suitable for use as railway sleepers, bridge construction, turnery, vehicles, cabinetwork, and carpentry, while some of its highest specially uses are for tool handles, walking sticks, fishing rods, and archery bows. Figured logs have been cut into veneer. Locally, the wood is also used extensively for fence posts, house poles, and building framing. It is also a good timber for naval construction and dock work above water and for general sporting goods items. In Brazil it finds wide use as factory flooring, machinery parts, mill rollers in sugar mills, and parts for vehicles and carts."@en .

Other Uses The wood is a rather dull greyish brown with a fine striping of deep brown, often in a conspicuous pattern on the tangential surface. It is without distinctive odour or taste; the grain is usually straight, but sometimes roey or wavy; the texture medium. The wood is moderately light and soft to rather hard and heavy; fairly durable. It is easy to work, finishes smoothly, seasons without difficulty. It is said that if the wood is cut green and stacked to dry, it acquires a dark colour, without losing its striping, and is then of different appearance from wood treated in the more usual manner. An excellent timber, it is used for a great variety of purposes such as heavy construction; furniture and cabinetwork; interior finish; boat building; carts, and many other kinds of work. A large part of the cheaper chairs of Central America are made from this wood."@en .
