Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."@en ;
  :plant_edible_text "None known"@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark, leaves and twigs are the source of a beverage that is hallucinogenic. Commonly used in the Amazonian rainforest, it is used shamanically as a tool to contact the spirits and bring healing, and is also used recreationally. The shoots, roots and leaves, sometimes as an admixture with other species, are used by Indians for the preparation of a hallucinogenic beverage, used for special ceremonies or the roots and stems are chewed for this purpose. The dried leaves are also smoked. In addition to its use as an hallucinogenic, the plant is also emetic and purgative. At low doses it is used as a mild detoxifier. The plant contains an alkaloid, known variously as 'telepathin', yagein' or 'banisterine', which has a strongly stimulatory action on the nervous system. The bark contains beta-carboline alkaloids, including harmine, harmaline and delta-tetrahycroharmine. These alkaloids stimulate hallucinations."@en ;

  :plant_hardiness_zones "9-12" ;
  :plant_hazards "The leaves and stems, if put in water, can stupefy fish. This possibly means they contain saponins. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish."@en ;

Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."@en ;

  :plant_edible_text "Fruit - raw or cooked. Thin-skinned and peculiarly odorous, with a white, juicy, oily pulp that varies in flavour from insipid to sweet, acid or cheese-like. A very popular fruit, it is usually eaten out of hand, and is also cooked as a dessert, used in jams, soups, sherbets etc. A refreshing drink, known as 'chicha', is obtained from the fermented fruits - it is very much relished by most Panamanians. The orange-yellow round fruit is up to 5cm in diameter with a single, fairly large stone, containing 1-3 white seeds. An edible fat is extracted from the fruit with boiling water."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark (probably the inner bark is rich in tannins and has been used medicinally by many local peoples. It is antidote, antiinflammatory, astringent, emmenagogue, febrifuge and purgative. It has been used to treat gastrointestinal disorders, including indigestion, diarrhoea and dysentery; pulmonary complaints; snakebites; fevers; cases of leucorrhoea; and to promote menstruation. The bark has been used externally as a wash or poultice to treat wounds, skin infections, ulcers etc. As a mouthwash it has been used to tighten the teeth where gums are diseased. An infusion of the leaves is used to treat high blood pressure. The leaves are used as a wash to clean and soothe ulcers. The brown powder from the under surface of the leaf is applied onto the cut end of the umbilical cord to prevent infection. The sap from the bark and leaves is inserted into the orifice of the penis as a treatment for gonorrhoea. The leaves contain various flavonoids, saponins and terpenes."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Small flowering tree, backyard tree, Accent, Large planter, Small street tree, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: The tree is well suited for the restoration of infertile and burned-over land. It has a heavy leaf fall which helps to restore soil fertility. Other Uses The bark contains 17-28 % tannin and 3 % oxalic acid. It is employed in tanning. The fruit is high in tannin, especially when unripe and is sometimes used in dyeing. The fruit skin imparts a light-brown hue to cotton cloth. An ink can be made from the bitter green fruit. The bark yields a strong fibre. The heartwood is a reddish or pinkish-brown; the thin band of sapwood is greyish. It is coarse-textured; close and cross-grained. The wood is heavy, hard, tough, strong, brittle, and only moderately durable. It takes a good polish. The wood is usually available only in small sizes; it is highly prized for boat ribs, and is used for tool handles, turnery, cabinetwork, furniture and small-scale construction. In Brazil, the wood is chosen for the hot fire over which people smoke the stimulant paste of guaran? (Paullinia cupana) because the burning wood has a pleasant odour. In some areas the wood is used for making a good quality charcoal. This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and birds."@en .
