  :plant_physical_characteristics "Costus Afer is an evergreen Perennial growing to 4 m (13ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a fast rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."@en ;
  :plant_edible_text "Leaves. An acid flavour. The rhizome is occasionally used as a spice or flavouring."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Spiral ginger is commonly used as a medicinal plant throughout tropical Africa and modern research has borne out the validity of many of its uses. The stem, seeds and rhizome contain several steroidal sapogenins, of which diosgenin is the most important one. The rhizome yields 0.5% diosgenin. Diosgenin is a very important raw material used as a precursor in the synthesis of a number of steroidal drugs, including corticosteroids, sex hormones, oral contraceptives and anabolic agents. The rhizomes also contain the saponins aferosides A and C, as well as dioscin and paryphyllin C and the flavonoid glycoside kaempferol 3-O-_-L-rhamnopyranoside. The last compound showed an ability to potentiate in vitro cisplatin cytotoxicity in a human colon cancer cell line. A papaverine-like alkaloid is found in the rhizome which causes relaxation of smooth muscle and is anti-spasmodic, diuretic and central nervous system depressant. The methanol extract of the rhizome showed significant topical anti-inflammatory activity. The saponin fraction from the rhizomes and the methanolic leaf extract showed significant abortifacient activity. Sesquiterpenoids are the most abundant group of volatile compounds in the essential oil of the leaves. The essential oil did not show any antimicrobial activity. The aqueous extract of the leaves and stems showed significant antibacterial and amoebicidal activity in vitro. The methanolic leaf extract showed significant cytotoxicity. The same extract showed moderate local anaesthetic activity. The extract exhibited antihyperglycaemic activity, and decreased the blood glucose level when applied in small doses; higher doses, however, increased the blood glucose level. A decoction of the powdered fruits is used as a cough medicine. The stem is strongly diuretic. The debarked stem is chewed to alleviate nausea and quench thirst. A stem decoction, the mashed or chewed stem or the pounded fruit, sometimes mixed with sugar cane juice, are taken to alleviate nausea; to treat rheumatoid arthritis; cough respiratory problems and sore throat. A cold water extract of the stem is taken to treat small epileptic attacks. The powdered stems are used as an enema to treat worms and haemorrhoids. The smoke of the dried stem is inhaled to treat coughs. The stem sap is used to treat jaundice and to prevent miscarriage. The stem sap is acid and rubefacient and burns on open wounds, but it is also anodyne and healing. It is applied externally to treat a range of skin ailments; urethral discharges and venereal diseases. It is also rubbed on the body to treat colic. An infusion of the inflorescence is taken to treat tachycardia. The same infusion or a rhizome infusion is taken to treat stomach complaints. The leaf sap, or a rhizome decoction, is taken to treat malaria. Externally, the leaf sap is used as eye drops to treat eye troubles and as nose drops to treat headache with vertigo. It is used in frictions to treat oedema and fever. An infusion of the dried aerial parts is taken to treat hypertension. The pulp of the rhizome is applied to abscesses and ulcers to mature them; it is applied to teeth to cure toothache; and mixed with water it is taken internally to treat diarrhoea and amoebic dysentery. A rhizome decoction or the raw rhizome is taken to treat leprosy and venereal diseases."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: Strips made from the outer stem are made into baskets. It is sometimes cultivated for the stem bark which is used to make table mats and baskets. Experiments to use the stem for making paper have been successful. The stems are used in house construction. The sap can be used to coagulate latex and is also used in skin nourishing creams."@en .
