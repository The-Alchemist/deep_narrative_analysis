  :plant_other_use_text "The tree prefers light shade, which makes it a good companion to overstorey tree species such as vi (Spondias cyathera), canarium nut (Canarium spp.), and breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis). Its open canopy structure allows sufficient light penetration to the ground level for other crops such as roots, cereals and other understorey crops such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and a nutritious native leafy tree spinach called bele or edible hibiscus (Abelmoschus manihot), to be interplanted under it. It has been used as a trellis tree for the cash crop betel leaf (Piper betle),as well as for marking land boundaries and creating windbreaks. The tree has a well formed lateral root system, yet does not appear to cause major impediments during soil preparation for understory crops, e.g., making mounds for the root crops, nor does it seem to compete heavily with understory crops. It can be used in plantations to provide shade for tree crops such as cacao (Theobroma cacao), joint fir (Gnetum gnemon), and betel nut (Areca catechu). Other Uses The wood is light in weight.

A mild flavour, the nuts are a common item of food, eaten raw and also roasted, salted or used in ice cream etc. The nuts are very nutritious, containing roughly 66% fat or oil, 17% protein and 7% carbohydrate. The ripe fruit is a wooden capsule weighing up to 750g and containing 12 - 24 angular brown seed, each about 5cm long and 2.5cm wide. An oil is obtained from the seed. The fresh-pressed oil is pale yellow, almost odourless, with a pleasant nutty flavour. It is not unlike almond oil in composition. It can be used like olive oil. Nuts have a high level of selenium. They are also high in sulphur containing amino acids."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Large Nut Tree, Public Open Spaces, Botanic Collections. Other Uses The hard woody 'fruit' that contains the seeds is used as cups or other receptacles. It is also made into bracelets or carved to make other ornaments. Empty fruit capsules are used to carry small, smoky fires in order to discourage black flies (Simulium spp.) from attacking people working in the field during the rainy season. Open capsules are sometimes used to collect latex from rubber trees. The oil obtained from the seed has been used as an illuminant. The oil has also sometimes been used in perfumery, paint and soap making, and as a lubricant for watches and clocks. The woody 'fruits' make an excellent fuel. The nut, which has an elevated oil content of 63-69%, burns with a candle-like flame when lit. The bark has been used in remote regions for fibre production. It is used for caulking ships. The heartwood is light brown to reddish; it is not clearly demarcated from the 3 - 5cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is medium, the grain straight or interlocked; lustre is medium. The wood is moderately heavy, hard and moderately durable being moderately resistant to fungi and termites but susceptible to dry wood borers. Seasoning is fairly fast with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It works well with normal tools; nailing and screwing are good; gluing is correct for internal purposes only. The durable wood is sought by boat builders, and is also used for purposes such as interior joinery, cabinet making, high class furniture, construction, flooring, heavy carpentry and sliced veneer. The felling of the trees is discouraged because they are more valuable as a nut crop, however the wood is well suited to all manner of structural work. The charcoal from Brazil nut shells is good at purifying water."@en .
