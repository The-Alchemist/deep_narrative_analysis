  :plant_medicinal_text "Though little known as a medicinal plant, rose root has been used in traditional European medicine for over three thousand years, mainly as a tonic. Modern research has shown that it increases the body's resistance to any type of stress by regulating the body's hormonal response. Its use has been shown to have a protective effect upon the neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine in the brain. It improves neurotransmitter activity by inhibiting their enzymatic destruction and preventing their decline caused by excessive stress hormone release. Rose root also enhances the transport of serotonin's precursors into the brain and studies have shown that use of this herb can increase brain serotonin by up to 30%. The root is adaptogen. It has an enhancing effect upon physical endurance and sexual potency. A decoction of the flowers has been used to treat stomach aches and intestinal discomfort. The raw flowers have been eaten in the treatment of tuberculosis."@en ;
  :plant_other_use :EssentialOil ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Plants can be grown as a ground cover when planted about 30cm apart each way. Other Uses: An extract of the root is used in cosmetic preparations as an antioxidant, astringent and skin conditioner.  The dried root smells strongly of roses. They may be used to distill rose-water. Ornamental."@en .

It is best planted about 45cm apart each way. Strong growing bulbs such as some lilies will grow happily through this ground cover. The plant can grow in very low moisture levels and has been used as a green covering on roofs. Green roofs are incorporated into the structure of the building, providing habitats for wildlife as well as insulating the building and helping to improve the environmen.t The subspecies minima and the cultivars 'Athorum' and 'Coral Carpet' have been specifically mentioned in this respect."@en .

As with many other remedies that are both astringent and soothing, houseleek simultaneously tightens and softens the skin. The fresh leaves are astringent, diuretic, odontalgic, refrigerant and vulnerary. They are used as a poultice in much the same way as Aloe vera in the treatment of a wide range of skin diseases, burns, scalds, bites and stings etc and have also been used to get rid of warts and corns. The plant is also sometimes used internally in the treatment of shingles, skin complaints and haemorrhoids, though some care is required since in excess the plant is emetic and purgative. The leaves are harvested as required and used fresh."@en ;
