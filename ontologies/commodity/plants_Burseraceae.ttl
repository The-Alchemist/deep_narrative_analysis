Agroforestry Uses: Trees are used as living fence to delimit pastures, using stakes 1 - 3 metres long, 10 - 15cm thick, and spaced 3 metres or more apart. Other Uses The bark yields a balsam resin known as American elemi, cachibok or gomart. It is used in varnishes and as a substitute for gum arabic (from Acacia spp.). It is painted on canoes to preserve the wood from insects etc. It is also used as a glue for mending broken china and glass. Used by the Maya as an incense since ancient times, it is still concentrated, dried and used in modern South America as incense in churches. The aromatic resin is a natural insect repellent, and no pests or diseases are reported for this species. The heartwood is white, yellowish, or light brown; it is not differentiated from the sapwood. Both the heartwood and sapwood are often discoloured to a gray by sap-staining fungi. The texture is fine to medium; the grain fairly straight; lustre is moderate and there is no distinctive taste or odour. The wood is soft, light in weight, firm, tough, not very durable in contact with the soil. It works easily with all types of tools and machines; saws cleanly; planes to a smooth finish; drills cleanly with some tearing at the exit side; and turns readily on the lathe. The wood takes all stains and polishes well and holds nails firmly without splitting. It is used for veneer, as plywood for interior use, in rustic furniture, for rough boxes and crates, as handles for tools, as soles for sandals, for match sticks and toothpicks, to build cabinets, to make decorative articles. When thoroughly dry, the wood is used as firewood or charcoal. This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds"@en .

They are considered to be antibacterial, antifungal, antirheumatic, antiseptic, antispasmodic and rubefacient. A study on the composition of Manila elemi oil from the distillation of elemi resin yielded 39 compounds, with limonene, the most abundant at 56%. A corn-sized drop of the resin is taken with water in the treatment of fevers and chills. The oleoresin is applied externally to arthritic and rheumatic joints, boils, abscesses, furuncles, burns and sores. It is heated and applied to the chest as a poultice to stop severe coughing. The tree bark is commonly used for postpartum baths. The essential oil is an ingredient of a commercial preparation called 'Lysout', a natural anti-lice foaming gel that also contains Echinacea purpurea."@en ;
  :plant_other_use :VegetableOil ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Other Uses: An oily resin called Manilla elemi is obtained from incisions in the bark. Manila elemi is a soft and fragrant oleoresin, oily, pale yellow to greenish, of honey consistency, balsamic in odour and bitter tasting. It is used in varnishes and inks; for caulking boats; torches; perfumery and for various medicinal applications. It can be used for the same purposes as turpentine. A tannin of reasonable quality is obtained from the bark. The wood is not very hard. It is used for light construction. This species is one of the sources of kedondong timber, which is obtained from several species in the family Burseraceae. However, the tree is more highly valued for its resin and edible seed and so is little harvested for its wood. We do not have a specific description of the wood for this species, but the general description of kedondong wood is as follows:- The heartwood is generally a light brown; it is not sharply demarcated from the 3 - 5cm wide band of lighter-coloured sapwood. The texture is moderately fine and even; the grain is interlocked to wavy; the surface is lustrous. The wood is light in weight; moderately hard; not very durable, being susceptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons somewhat slowly with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately stable to stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; it is moderately easy to slightly difficult to plane; finishes smooth to rough; can be easy to very difficult to bore; slightly difficult to difficult to turn; nailing and screwing properties are good; gluing is correct. The wood is suitable for internal use as a general utility timber for planking, cladding, plywood, flooring, furniture, packing cases, pallets and general carpentry work."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "Seed - raw or cooked. A popular nut. The sweet nuts have a delicious flavour. When raw, their flavour resembles roasted pumpkin seed, when roasted their mild, nutty flavour and tender, crispy texture are superior to the almond. They can also be used in confections, ice cream, nut milks etc, and as an adulterant to chocolate. The coat surrounding the kernel should be removed since it can cause diarrhoea. The shell is very thick and difficult to crack, though some thinner shelled forms have been found. Nutritionally, the kernel contains 71.1% fat, 11.4% protein and 8.4% carbohydrates; it is high in calcium, phosphorus and potassium. The kernel is a major ingredient in a famous Chinese festive dessert known as the 'moon cake'. However, kernels from some trees may be bitter, fibrous or have a turpentine odour. The seed keeps very well in storage. A sweet, light-yellow oil obtained from the seed is used for cooking purposes. It is comparable in quality to that of olive oil, containing up to 59% oleic glycerides and 32-59% of palmitic glycerides. An oil can be extracted from the fruit pulp. It has a tangy, resin-like flavour and can be used for cooking. The fruit pulp is boiled, seasoned and eaten. Rather tasteless. It resembles the sweet potato in texture, it is oily (about 12%) and is considered to have food value similar to the avocado. Young shoots - raw. Eaten in salads."@en ;

Agroforestry Uses: The tree makes an excellent windbreak as it resists strong winds and even typhoons. Other Uses: The hard and thick shell that encloses the kernel makes an excellent fuel for cooking. Polished and varnished, the stony thick shell becomes an attractive ornament. The stony shells are excellent as a porous, inert growth medium for orchids and anthuriums. A valuable resin, called Manila elemi or 'breabianca', is used as an ingredient in the manufacture of plastics, printing inks and perfumes. It is also is used by the Spaniards for ship repairs. The plant contains two different oils. That obtained from the seed is of similar quality to olive oil. An oil contained in the fruit pulp can be extracted and used as a substitute for cottonseed oil in the manufacture of soap and edible products. It is used in making suntan lotions and cosmetics.

It is obtained by slashing the bark and allowing the colourless expiation to trickle to the ground where it solidifies into a sulphur-yellow opaque resin. The resin is used as primitive illuminant and as incense and releases a lavender-like smell. The resin burns readily and is used as a bush candle. The flame is very smoky and soot is collected as carbon-black from the outside of pots held over it for use in tattooing and to make ink in Liberia. The resin is also used to repair broken pottery, for caulking boats and as a gum for fastening arrowheads to shafts. The resin contains 8-20 % of an essential oil, the main constituent of which is limonene. It is rich in phellandrenes, and contains also resins and a bitter principle. The resin is used as a fumigant against mosquitoes. The elemi is often left standing on cleared land to provide shade and has potential as a wind break. It has been planted for reforestation in Uganda. The endocarp is used by children as spinning tops. The seeds are strung into necklaces or attached to traditional instruments. The bark of young trees is split off in Gabon to make boxes. The wood is said to secrete oil and is used for canoe making. The heartwood is pinkish when fleshly cut but darkens to light brown mahogany colour; it is not slearly demarcated from the 5 - 15cm wide band of sapwood that is white with pinkish reflections. The texture is slightly coarse; the grain interlocked, thus causing a fine striped figure on quarter-sawn boards. The wood is light in weight; very soft; not very durable, being suseptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons slowly but fairly well, though there is a risk of distortion and checking; once dry it is poorly stable in service. works easily, stains and polishes well. Used as a substitute for true mahogany. The timber is used as core veneer, for decorative panelling, parquetry, furniture, flooring and for general utility purposes.

It is used in the treatment of muscular rheumatism. The gum resin has been used extensively by Ayurvedic physicians for centuries to treat a wide variety of disorders. It is a natural health product, used primarily to reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels. It has been used for many years as a hypocholesterolemic agent in India, where it is has received prescription drug status, due to its high level of efficacy as determined by clinical trials."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is sometimes grown as a barrier hedge. Other Uses The tree is the source of Guggul or Indian Bdellium, a gum-resin that exudes from the branches. It is largely used as an incense and in perfumery. The thick branches are selected in winter and their bark incised to extract the oleo resin gum. The commercial product of the oleo-gum resin contains 58% resin along with mineral matter, 32.3% gum, 4.65% foreign organic matter and 1.45% aromatic essential oil. Young branches are used as a toothbrush to clean the teeth and maintain dental hygiene."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "Fruit - raw or cooked. A pleasant, subacid flavour. The leathery shelled stone is surrounded by a pulpy, butyraceous pericarp about 5 mm thick which is the portion eaten, either raw, or cooked to form a sort of 'butter'. When placed in hot water it softens and swells and all the flesh then slides easily off the seed. The fruit flesh is softened by cell-wall-degrading enzymes. At temperatures of 60 - 85c this is accomplished in a matter of minutes; at room temperature, it takes 7 - 10 days, with bruising and microbes reducing this period to 3 days. Boiling inactivates the enzymes so that the pulp hardens. The fruit is usually salted and tastes like a warmed ripe avocado with a slightly sour flavour. It has a mild smell of turpentine and is oily with palmitic acid 36.5%, oleic acid 33.9 %, linoleic acid 24.0% and stearic acid 5.5%. The fruit contains 7% protein, which is very high for a fruit. The fruit is up to 70mm long and 30mm wide. The seed kernel is also rich in oil of the same fatty acids and approximately in similar amounts. Carbon Farming - Staple Crop: protein-oil."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The resin from the bark is used to treat parasitic skin diseases, jiggers etc. A bark-decoction is taken powdered with maleguetta pepper as an anti-dysenteric, and for anaemia, spitting blood and as an emmenagogue. The decoction is also used for making gargles and mouth-washes, for treating tonsillitis. The pulped-up bark is used as a wound cicatrizant. Combined with palm-oil, it is applied topically to relieve general pains and stiffness and to treat cutaneous conditions. The leaves are eaten raw with kola nut as an antiemetic. The leaf-sap is instilled into the ear for ear-trouble. A leaf-decoction is prepared as a vapour-bath for treating feverish stiffness with headache."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The leaves and the remains of the fruits can provide considerable quantities of biomass to improve soil fertility. Research carried out in the forest humid lowland of south Cameroon, showed that the peasant farmers use the tree as a good indicator of soils fertility. The plant's canopy can allow its integration into the traditional farming systems involving food crops, mainly shade tolerant species such as Xanthosoma saggittifolium, Colocosia esculenta etc. Other Uses: The bark is aromatic and on injury yields a resin. This is used in various ways - in perfumery; as an adhesive for mending broken earthenware; as a waterproofing the inner surface of calabashes; it can also be burnt as a primitive lamp-oil or bush-candle. The resin, under steam distillation, has been reported to yield a peppery essential oil rich in sabinene, _-phellandrene and limonene, and a non-volatile fraction of crystalline canaric acid, a keto acid and the corresponding hydroxy acid. The fruit contains about 1.5% essential oil. Its main constituents are: myrcene (45%), alpha-pinene (9%), alpha-terpineol (8%) and germacrene-D (4%); minor compounds include: E-alpha-cadinol, sigma-cadinol and _beta-udesmol. The wood contains an oil that on petrol-ether extraction has been found to be composed of fatty acids and their esters. The fresh pulp is rich in lipids (35-65%) with a considerable amount of palmitic and linoleic acid. The tree can produce 7 - 8 t/ha of oil. The leaves are the source of a dye. The heartwood is greyish white to pinkish; it is not clearly demarcated from the sapwood. The wood is moderately heavy and elastic, the texture moderately coarse. It is somewhat difficult to work due to the presence of silica, rapidly blunting tools during sawing; planing may be problematic due to the interlocked grain; staining, polishing and gluing properties are good, it can be peeled satisfactorily. It is used for axe-handles, occasionally for mortars, and is suitable for carpentry, etc. The wood is used mainly for fuel. Other Systems: homegarden, multistrata."@en .
