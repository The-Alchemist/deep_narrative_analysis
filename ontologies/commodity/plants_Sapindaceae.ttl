The fleshy fruit can also be curried, used in soups, stews, etc. The fruit is harvested when they have split open naturally, revealing four large glossy black seeds embedded in spongy, cream-coloured buttery arils. The pear-shaped fruit is about 75mm long, 45mm wide, and is produced in clumps of 3 - 10. The fruit must be allowed to open fully, or at least partly, before it is detached from the tree. Unripe or overripe arils, as well as the seeds, contain hypoglycin and its derivative - they are strongly toxic. The seeds yield a yellowish oil that is believed to be edible."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The plant (part not specified) is used to treat anaemia and itching. In traditional medicine in Cote d?Ivoire, Blighia sapida is widely used for the treatment of yellow fever, epilepsy and oedema, and as a laxative and diuretic. Sap from terminal buds is instilled in the eyes to treat ophthalmia and conjunctivitis. The pulp of ground-up leafy twigs is rubbed on the forehead to treat migraine. The ground-up leaves, combined with plant salts, are applied as a paste to treat yaws and ulcers. The leaves are used in the treatment of fever and vertigo, and twigs to treat hepatitis, cirrhosis and amygdalitis. Bark and leaf decoctions are administered to treat oedema, intercostal pain, dysentery and diarrhoea. Decoctions of bark or fruit walls are applied to wounds. Pounded bark is administered as an antidote to snake and scorpion bites. The bark, ground-up with capsicum pepper (Capsicum annuum), is rubbed on the body as a stimulant. The seeds are taken to treat stomach complaints, including nausea and vomiting. Aqueous seed extracts are administered to expel parasites. The fruit pulp is used to treat whitlow. A water-soluble and heat-stable toxic compound, hypoglycin A, is present in the aril of unripe seeds, as well as in the seed and in the pinkish to reddish tissue at the base of the aril. The Jamaican vomiting sickness is associated with this compound and is characterized by vomiting, generalized weakness, altered consciousness and sometimes even death. Hypoglycaemia and depression of the central nervous system are common. The aril of fully ripe seeds after natural dehiscence of the fruit is nearly free of the toxic compound. The consumption of unripe seed arils has probably caused many cases of encephalopathy in children in Burkina Faso and other West African countries."@en ;

The flowers are used in the preparation of an aromatic water. Used as a cosmetic. The green fruits lather in warm water and are used as soap for washing and as a mordant for dyeing. The oil from the seeds are used in making traditional soap. The seeds contain about 26% of oil which is suitable for industrial applications. An ink for tattoos is made from the seeds. The heartwood is orange-brown or reddish brown; it is distinctly demarcated from the whitish sapwood. The texture is moderately coarse; the wood has little lustre. It is moderately heavy, hard, moderately durable and quite resistant to termite attack. It is easy to work with both machine and hand tools. The wood moulds and sands well and takes an attractive finish. The wood is mainly used for light construction and furniture, but sometimes also for casks, boxes, crates, food containers, packing cases, tool handles, paddles, pestles, mortars, handicrafts, carving and turnery. It is suitable for interior trim, joinery and railway sleepers. Dried fruit husks are rich in potash. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal. Wild fruit for birds and bats nectar for bees.

The Rainforest tribes have used guarana mainly as a stimulant, astringent and in treating chronic diarrhoea. The powdered seed is taken internally to relieve fatigue, aid concentration and lift the spirits. One report says that overuse can cause sleeplessness, although less so than caffeine-based drinks, whilst others say that the stimulating effect is due to caffeine.

Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish.

  :plant_other_use_text "Shade tree. Seaside. Small street tree. Botanic collection. Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: A plant of moderate growth-rate that is tolerant of a wide range of soils and environmental situations; provides food for the native fauna; materials and medicines for humans; and is tolerant of sunny situations, this is an excellent pioneer species to use when restoring native woodland and also for establishing woodland gardens. Other Uses When cut up and soaked in water, the fleshy fruit (which smells of strawberries) produces soapy suds. The husks contain about 30% saponins and are used in some areas to wash wool and silk with remarkable rejuvenating results. The fruit is used as a soap and hair shampoo. The orange-brown fruit is about 2cm in diameter. An insecticide has been made from the crushed seeds. An oil is obtained from the seed. A fibre obtained from the inner bark is used to make ropes. The ornamental, black, shiny seeds have been used as beads and for making craftwork, rosaries and buttons. The heartwood is yellow to light brown; the sapwood whitish. The wood is coarse-textured, compact, hard, moderately heavy, not durable when exposed. It can be used in building construction, making toys, boxes etc."@en .

The oil is also used in the batik industry, and in southern India, as a cooling bath oil The oil content of the kernel varies from 59-72%. The oil is yellowish-brown and semi-solid and consists of oleic acid (52%), arachidic acid (20%), stearic acid (10%), gadoleic acid (9%). The bark contains about 10% tannin and a dye. The heartwood is reddish to pinkish-brown; it is clearly demarcated from the sapwood. The wood is very hard, very heavy, very strong. It is durable in water according to some reports, but not durable according to another. It cracks very easily during seasoning. It is difficult to work, being very hard to saw, though it can be planed to a very smooth surface which takes a high, lasting polish. An excellent wood for making pestles, cartwheels, axles, ploughs, tool handles and rollers of sugar mills and oil presses, it is also used in house construction, ship building and musical instruments. The wood is suitable as firewood and makes excellent charcoal. The energy value of the wood is about 20 800 kJ/kg. Fodder: Bank, Insect."@en .
