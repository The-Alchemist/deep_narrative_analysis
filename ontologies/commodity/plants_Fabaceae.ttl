  :plant_medicinal_text "The use of the bark and roots by local peoples is widespread. They are astringent and febrifuge. They are used, either externally or internally, as a treatment for respiratory infections, digestive disorders, haemorrhages, malaria and other fevers etc. The bark is used to clean the teeth, as it is believed to contain fluorine. An extract is used to treat toothache."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: White acacia is a very good soil improver and stabilizer. Its spreading root system offers excellent protection to the soil along the banks of watercourses. Bacteria on its roots fix atmospheric nitrogen, whilst it also sheds its leaves in the rainy season; therefore boosting the nutrient status of the soil for the new season?s crops. The fact that the tree is leafless during the rainy season minimizes competition for sunlight with crops and protects them from birds until harvest time. It is commonly intercropped with annual crops, especially pearl millet and groundnuts. Yields of millet are much higher under a canopy of this tree; increases of 50 - 150% having been recorded. Results for sorghum, cotton, groundnut and maize are variable and either positive or negative, depending on the study. The effect may depend on soil fertility - when this is high, the tree competes with the crops. The tree is maintained and protected on farms in order to shade coffee and to provide shade during the dry season. The plant has been recommended for integration with maize as an alternative to Leucaena leucocephala. Other Uses A gum arabic, called 'Gomme de Senegal', is obtained from the stems. The bark is used to clean the teeth, as it is believed to contain fluorine. The bark contains 20 - 28%f tannins. The wood is burnt and used as a source of potash when making soap. The heartwood is pale and creamy; the brown sapwood slightly paler than the heartwood. The wood is hard, of medium weight. It is susceptible to staining fungi and pinhole borer when green; therefore, it is left to soak for several months to remove sap and minimize attack by fungi, borers and termites. Even after the most careful seasoning, the boards tend to spring and twist one or two hours after they are sawn. The wood works fairly easily by hand, but a smooth finish is difficult to obtain. Care must be taken when nailing, bolting and joining. It is used to make utensils, handicrafts, canoes, furniture, boxes, drums and oil presses. The wood is an excellent fuel. The calorific value is estimated at 19.741 kJ/kg of dry wood. It is used to make a high quality charcoal. Charcoal yields are as low as 17%."@en .

Some species produce a gum that is dark and is liable to be astringent and distasteful, but others produce a light gum and this is sweet and pleasant. It can be sucked like candy or soaked in water to make a jelly. The gum can be warmed when it becomes soft and chewable. Seed - cooked. It is dried, ground into a flour and used with cereals in making cakes etc. Acacia seeds are highly nutritious and contain approx 26% protein, 26% available carbohydrate, 32% fibre and 9% fat. The fat content is higher than most legumes with the aril providing the bulk of fatty acids present. These fatty acids are largely unsaturated which is a distinct health advantage although it presents storage problems as such fats readily oxidise. The mean total carbohydrate content of 55.8 + 13.7% is lower than that of lentils, but higher than that of soybeans while the mean fibre content of 32.3 + 14.3% is higher than that of other legumes such as lentils with a level of 11.7%. The energy content is high in all species tested, averaging 1480+270 kJ per 100g. Wattle seeds are low glycaemic index foods. The starch is digested and absorbed very slowly, producing a small, but sustained rise in blood glucose and so delaying the onset of exhaustion in prolonged exercise. A sweet red or white 'lerp' that forms on the leaves and branches is eaten. Lerp is a protective shield secreted from the anus of sap-sucking insects. The taste is sweet and it was used as a staple food by the Aborigines in some areas of Australia. It is not clear if the lerp is eaten when the insects are still present or if it can be eaten after they have gone. A large succulent gall, known as 'mulga apple' is produced by the tree and is said to quench the thirst."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Acacia angustissima is an important medicinal species for the Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya Indians in Mexico. They rank it the 4th most important species in the cure of bloody diarrhoea and 7th in the treatment of mucoid diarrhoea. It is also used as a cure for toothache, rheumatism and skin lesions, and is reported to inhibit growth in malignant tumours. Tests also show that it possesses a mild antimicrobial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The medical activity will at least be partly due to the astringent tannins found in the plant. The bark of all Acacia species contains greater or lesser quantities of tannins and are astringent. Astringents are often used medicinally - taken internally, for example. they are used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, and can also be helpful in cases of internal bleeding. Applied externally, often as a wash, they are used to treat wounds and other skin problems, haemorrhoids, perspiring feet, some eye problems, as a mouth wash etc. Many Acacia trees also yield greater or lesser quantities of a gum from the trunk and stems. This is sometimes taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and haemorrhoids."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Although it may not grow into a large tree, it can be extremely valuable for use as pioneer species for rejuvenating degraded lands, and as a nurse crop for more valuable tree species. Its potential as a mulch producer has come into question, because of the presence of secondary compounds that bind the nitrogen and result in low quality (slowly decomposing) prunings. This may mean that the mulch is a poor nitrogen source for the present crop, but it may have greater residual effects that could benefit the subsequent crop, or be a good nitrogen source to help build up organic matter in the soil. These long-term benefits could outweigh the initial low nutrient return to the soil over a number of years. Slowly decomposing prunings may have value for suppressing weed growth in associated crops. Other Uses: Tannin is obtained from the bark. Bark harvested for its tannins should only be taken from mature stems, and only when the sap is rising at the beginning of the growing season - which is when the tannin content is highest and the bark is most easily removed from the wood. Carbon Farming  - Industrial Crop: biomass. Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, alley crop."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Attractive flowers or blooms. Agroforestry Uses: In its native habitat, the tree is a colonizer of tropical coastal lowlands. It has the potential to be a pioneer species, but its tendency to spread into the local environment reduces its value as a pioneer outside of its native range. The plant has a spreading, superficial and densely matted root system, which makes it suitable for stabilizing eroded land. Its rapid early growth, even on infertile sites, ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and tolerance of both highly acidic and alkaline soils make it popular for stabilizing and revegetating mine spoils. Plantations of the tree improve soil physio-chemical properties such as water-holding capacity, organic carbon, nitrogen and potassium through litter fall. Its phyllodes provide a good, long-lasting mulch. The dense, dark-green foliage, which remains throughout the dry season, makes it an excellent shade tree. Other Uses The bark contains sufficient tannin (13 - 25%) for commercial exploitation A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark. The heartwood is light brown to dark red; it is demarcated from the yellow sapwood. The wood is hard, has a high basic density; is fine and straight-grained; often attractively figured; reasonably durable and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available. The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite semi-chemical pulp. A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Acacia colei is a colonising species, forming dense regrowth populations in disturbed sites, including roadsides and burnt-over areas. The plant can be used as a pioneer for restoring native woodland or establishing woodland gardens. It has been planted as a windbreak around fields and along roadsides. Its bushy habit to ground level and heavy fall of large slowly decomposing phyllodes enhance its value for sand stabilisation. It has given very satisfactory results when planted as the lower part of windbreaks with Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The plant has a shallow, wide-spreading root system that competes heavily with nearby crops and can reduce their yields. On sandy soils in semi-arid zones, the plant may be used in a wide alley cropping system (about 20 metres between rows) where its benefits as a low windbreak may outweigh its depletion of soil moisture in the crop root zone.

The plant can be used as a pioneer for restoring native woodland or establishing woodland gardens. It has been planted as a windbreak around fields and along roadsides. Its bushy habit to ground level and heavy fall of large slowly decomposing phyllodes enhance its value for sand stabilisation. It has given very satisfactory results when planted as the lower part of windbreaks with Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The plant has a shallow, wide-spreading root system that competes heavily with nearby crops and can reduce their yields. On sandy soils in semi-arid zones, the plant may be used in a wide alley cropping system (about 20 metres between rows) where its benefits as a low windbreak may outweigh its depletion of soil moisture in the crop root zone. Other Uses: A red dye can be obtained from the lipid-rich arils by soaking them in water. The heartwood is dark brown; it is clearly demarcated from the pale sapwood. The wood is hard, dense. It is suitable for the manufacture of small decorative articles, and can be used for light construction. The wood is an excellent source of firewood and charcoal.

It can, therefore, be very effective in preventing soil erosion. Densely packed plantations have proved effective in preventing further erosion, even on hillsides of up to 50 degrees slope. The tree has been planted as a shelterbelt, a firebelt and as a shade tree in plantations. An efficient nitrogen-fixer and good source of green manure, it thus can restore and regenerate soils. Other Uses Wattle bark is the most widely used tannin material in the world. It contains 30 - 45% (dry basis) high-quality tannins. A powdered bark extract is also used to prepare tannin formaldehyde adhesives for exterior grade plywood, particleboard and laminated timber. Possibilities of using the bark in the production of biodegradable polyurethane foam are being tested. The heartwood is pale brown with a pinkish tinge; it is not sharply demarcated from the sapwood. The texture is moderately fine and uniform; the grain commonly interlocked; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste.The wood is moderately hard to hard, heavy, fairly tough and strong, not very durable. It dries rapidly, but with pronounced warp, particularly cupping; shakes tend to open and knots to split slightly. It is moderately easy to work and polishes well. It is used for house poles, mine props, tool handles, cabinet work, joinery, flooring, construction timber and matchwood. The pulp productivity is about 320 kg/cubic metre. Testing has shown that it yields a pulp with good strength characteristics and is suitable for wrapping paper and hardboard. It is also used for rayon. Originally distributed as a source of tannin, black wattle is now recognized as a valuable fuel wood. The wood is moderately dense with specific gravity about 0.75, splits easily and burns well with a calorific value of 3,500 - 4,600 kcal/kg. The charcoal is extensively used in Brazil and Kenya, and in Indonesia the tree is extensively used as a domestic fuel and for curing tobacco."@en .

It is known to have been planted as a windbreak in some areas. Other Uses The wood exudes a gum-like resin when the trees are felled. The sapwood is whitish; the heartwood is bright red to brownish-red with darker veins, making it very decorative. The wood is not very durable and is prone to attack by fungi and insects, but it impregnates well. The grain is straight to slightly interlocked, sometimes wavy; the texture is coarse and even; the is wood is lustrous. It is heavy, moderately hard, and compact. It is easy to work with tools and is well suited for turnery, carving and polishing. The wood is used for interior trim, panelling, furniture and cabinet work. Because it splits easily and regularly, it makes excellent roof shingles. Within its native range it is also used for general construction, floors, stairways, doors, tea crates, beehive frames, and after being impregnated, for railway ties.

It is compatible with most tropical field and tree crops, making it suitable to use in integrated production systems. It is inter-planted among field and tree crops such as spices, coffee and coconuts. It is often grown as a shade tree for coffee and nutmeg. Other Uses The bark is rich in saponins and can be used as a soap for washing clothes etc. Also used as a hair shampoo. The plant is a source of dyestuffs. A red dye is obtained from the shredded bark. The dye has been used for dyeing clothes, and is used by the Hindus of India for the sacred mark placed on the forehead. The red, glossy seeds are used as toys and for beads in necklaces and other ornaments. They were formerly used to weigh gold, silver and diamonds, because they have a narrow range in weight. Goldsmiths use the seeds in soldering. The heartwood is bright yellow when fresh, turning red upon exposure to the air; it is sharply demarcated from the light grey sapwood, which can be up to 5 cm wide. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, close-grained and durable. It can be easy or somewhat difficult to work, easy to plane and it takes a high finish. The heartwood is resistant to dry wood termites. A valued timber in many countries, being used for cabinet making, construction, flooring, paving blocks, vehicle bodies and fine art. Esteemed in the Pacific Islands for fuel wood, the wood burns readily, producing significant heat, and is used in both above- and below-ground ovens. The wood yields very good charcoal."@en .

Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing tree that fixes atmospheric nitrogen and succeeds in full sun, it is an excellent plant to use as a pioneer when establishing woodland or woodland gardens, though its ability to invade areas outside its native range means that it is best used only within its native area. Due to its extensive, fairly shallow root system, the tree is a good soil binder and is recommended for eroded lands and erosion control, for example along river embankments. The nitrogen-rich leaves are valuable as mulch and green manure. Light transmission through the canopy of free-standing trees is 40 - 50%. Free-standing trees appear to enhance pasture production and quality beneath the canopy due to the increased nitrogen status of the soil. In an open woodland environment it has been repeatedly observed that there is modification of the ground cover with enhancement of grass production and quality beneath the canopy. Seedlings and cuttings are used as an initial shade in coffee, cardamom, cocoa plantations etc. The tree is also used in rehabilitating old cocoa farms or on improved fallows intended for cocoa cultivation due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Although not completely wind firm, the tree is tolerant of salt-laden winds and can be planted in moderately exposed coastal situations and as quick-growing shelter for less hardy plants. A valued honey tree because of its production of both nectar and pollen. Other Uses It seems probable that the fruits can yield 10 barrels of ethanol per hectare per year. The trunk yields a reddish gum that is used as an adulterant of gum arabic. A red dye is obtained from the bark. It can cause skin irritation. The bark contains 7 - 11% tannin and is used locally in India for tanning fishing nets. When dried and pounded, the bark can be used for soap. The heartwood is golden brown when freshly cut, turning to a rich dark brown with black streaks; it is clearly demarcated from the paler sapwood. The texture is medium to coarse; the grain deeply interlocked; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste The wood is moderately heavy and hard; strong and fairly durable. It seasons well, works and polishes easily. An excellent, very decorative timber, it has been compared to black walnut. The wood is suitable for turnery, carving, general construction, furniture, veneer, agricultural implements etc. More generally the wood is useful for fuel wood because of its high productivity.

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: The tree is widely planted for its good soil-binding capacity. It is occasionally cultivated as shade tree for tea and coffee plantations, where it also acts as a wind and firebreak. It is popular for the rehabilitation of seasonally dry, eroded and degraded soils. Its ability to grow on dry, sandy, stony and shallow soils makes it a useful species for reforestation of difficult sites. Good survival and rapid early growth have been reported in reforestation trials on both saline and alkaline soils, which are widely cultivated in agroforestry systems. Other Uses The bark can provide tanning material. It is used in India for tanning and dyeing. However, its low tannin content (12-17%), considerable weight loss in drying, and difficult harvesting have limited its importance. When injured, the stem exudes large amounts of a reddish-brown gum that is chemically similar to, and used as a substitute for, gum arabic (obtained from Acacia senegal and other species). The leaves are known to have insecticidal and piscicidal properties. The branches (twigs) are used by tea planters as stakes for laying out tea gardens. These are found to split well. The species is popular along field borders. Pods and fallen leaves should be considered not as undesirable litter but as potential energy sources. It seems probable that if the pods of the related species A. Lebbeck can yield 10 barrels of ethanol per hectare, then this species could as well. The timber has a large amount of non-durable, yellowish-white sapwood. The heartwood is hard and heavy, light or dark brown with light and dark bands. Due to the broadly interlocked nature of the grain, it is more suitable for use in large sections where a bolder effect is desired, such as in large-sized panels and tabletops. It seasons and polishes well. The wood is used chiefly for construction, furniture, veneer, cabinet work, flooring, agricultural implements, moulding, carts, carriages, cane crushers, carvings, boats, oars, oil presses and rice pounders. It is resistant to several species of termites. The chemical analysis of the wood indicates that it is a suitable material for paper pulp. Bleached pulp in satisfactory yields (50.3%) can be prepared from A. Procera wood by the sulphate process. It is suitable for writing and printing paper (mean fibre length is 0.9 mm, mean fibre diameter is 0.021 mm). The calorific value of dried sapwood is 4870 kcal/kg, and that of heartwood 4865 kcal/kg. An excellent charcoal (39.6%) can be prepared from the wood, and it is widely used as a fuel."@en .

Pinto peanut is mostly used as a permanent pasture in intensive grazing systems and in very shaded situations under plantation crops. It can be used as a ground cover or as an ornament (Cook et al., 2005). Arachis pintoi is tolerant to heavy grazing and is compatible with aggressive grasses such as Brachiaria (Hess et al., 2003). It is potentially capable of producing high yields of forage in the tropics and improving soils and degraded pastures (Cab Jimenez et al., 2008). Useful for pasture, ground cover and as an ornament. Pinto peanut is a valuable forage, easy to establish, persistent, and combines well in mixtures under a wide range of climate and soil conditions, including heavy grazing. Pinto peanut is a good ground cover crop that can completely cover the soil in less than 6 month. Pinto peanut is used as a live mulch for soil conservation and weed suppression, particularly in shaded situations such as under trees and vines. Once established, pinto peanut may outcompete weeds and is thus useful for weed control. In its early stages, it may be useful to control weeds to ease its development (Abdul-Baki et al., 2002)."@en .

Young seeds are often eaten raw. Generally the young seeds are believed to have a better flavour than older ones, though some people prefer to eat germinating mature seeds. The seedpod is 20 - 25cm long and 3 - 4cm wide, twisted in a wide spiral. Mature seeds contain djenkolic acid and need careful preparation to neutralize it. Traditionally, they are boiled in three changes of water. Sometimes the seeds are boiled in a mixture of water, wood ash, bamboo leaves and pieces of steel or nails, discarding the cook water a number of times. The resulting beans are said to be highly nutritious. Other ways in which the seeds are prepared are:- 1). Boiled thoroughly till the offensive smell has disappeared, then consumed with salt and grated coconut. 2). Steeped for a couple of hours in salt water, before being fried in oil. This also removes most of the bad smell. 3). Made into a local delicacy, called emping. After cooking, the cotyledons are flattened by hammering them one by one into the shape of small cakes which are sun-dried, and fried in coconut oil and sprinkled with salt before consumption. 4). Buried for 14 days until they germinate, then dug up and washed clean, whilst at the same time the sprouts are cut off and thrown away. The latter way of preparation is said to minimize the danger of intoxication by jengkolic acid, crystals of which can cause kidney failure.

The root is a sweet tonic herb that stimulates the immune system and many organs of the body, whilst lowering blood pressure and blood sugar levels. It is particularly suited to young, physically active people, increasing stamina and endurance and improving resistance to the cold - indeed for younger people it is perhaps superior to ginseng in this respect. Huang Qi is used especially for treatment of the kidneys and also to avoid senility. The plant is often used in conjunction with other herbs such as Atractylodes macrocephala and Ledebouriella seseloides. The root contains a number of bio-active constituents including saponins and isoflavonoids. It is adaptogen, antipyretic, diuretic, tonic, uterine stimulant and vasodilator. It is used in the treatment of cancer, prolapse of the uterus or anus, abscesses and chronic ulcers, chronic nephritis with oedema and proteinuria. Recent research in the West has shown that the root can increase the production of interferon and macrophages and thus help restore normal immune function in cancer patients. Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy recover faster and live longer if given Huang Qi concurrently. The root of 4 year old plants is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use. The plant is antipyretic, diuretic, pectoral and tonic. Extracts of the plant are bactericidal, hypoglycaemic and hypotensive. Cardiotonic, vasodilator.HIV Infections ."@en ;

The texture is fine and even; the grain straight or slightly inter-locked; lustre is low; there is no characteristic odor or taste. Moist wood in contact with iron may stain because of the tannin content. The wood is heavy, fine-grained, strong and very durable, with a moderate resistance to termites. A slow-drying wood with little or no degrade. It is rather difficult to saw and machine, with severe blunting of cutters and a gumming of teeth if sawn green; it is excellent for turnery and has good gluing properties. Rated as one of the worlds finest commercial timbers, it is used as a general timber for bridge construction, flooring, railway sleepers, furniture, and is used in certain areas as fencing posts. The wood is little used locally because it is too hard for native tools to cut. The wood makes a good fuel, producing very hot coals. It is also used to make charcoal."@en .

Extracts of fresh leaves inhibited digestion, showed antidiarrhoeal effects and also demonstrated analgesic activity. An infusion of the leaves is drunk to cure enteritis and other gastrointestinal problems. The powdered leaves are taken with palm wine or food to cure venereal diseases. Combined with Senna occidentalis, it is drunk against asthma; in combination with the leaves of Morinda lucida it is a treatment against female sterility and painful menstruation. A decoction of the leaves is taken against jaundice and diabetes. The leaves have also been used as an enema to treat constipation. The leaves or leaf juice are used externally against parasitic skin diseases. Combined with Cissus quadrangularis, it is used to treat bone fractures. Both leaves and bark are considered haemostatic and anti-inflammatory, and are used for healing sores and wounds. A bark decoction is drunk to cure epilepsy and cardiac pain. The powdered heartwood is made into an ointment with shea butter (Vitellaria paradoxa) and is applied to stiff and swollen joints, sprains and rheumatic complaints.

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: The plant responds well to trimming and is grown as a hedge and fence. Other Uses The heartwood and roots yield a red dye that is used to dye raffia and cotton textiles. It was exported on a large scale to Europe from the 17th century and to North America from the 18th century as one of the main ?redwood? dyes for wool, cotton and silk. It was considered by European and American dyers to have a colouring power 3 - 4 times stronger than the other 'insoluble' redwoods they were using. In the wool industry, camwood was not only used to obtain red colours but a large range of reddish to dark brown colours called 'drabs', 'muddy brown' and 'London smoke', mostly in combination with other dyewoods. In small quantities, it was an ingredient of recipes for bronze-green colours and was used as ground dye followed by a logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum) dye bath. It was used for dark grey and black colours in the wool-cloth industry until the beginning of the 20th century. It was a major source of bright to dark red colours in the big European cotton-printing industries, e.g. to dye bandanas in 'mock turkey red', and it was also used, principally in the United Kingdom, to dye silk pink, 'acid brown' and 'light claret'. In West Africa, powdered heartwood is a familiar red body paint that is considered to have magic powers. A paste of the heartwood is much used as a cosmetic for the skin. By soaking the dried and ground roots in water a red liquid is obtained, which is used for painting furniture. In southern Benin and south-western Nigeria, Yoruba ceremonial masks are painted dark red with a decoction of the wood. In Nigeria, Tiv people colour the inside of a gourd prepared as a beehive with the red dye to attract a swarm to settle there and Yoruba honey-hunters rub their body with the dye paste to prevent bee-stings. The dye is found in the heartwood, which often is of small size. It is present in varying concentrations, up to about 23%. The dye is soluble in alkali and alcohol, much less so in water. In the Colour Index the number of the dye is 75560 and it is classified as Natural Red 22, together with other redwoods. The twigs are used as chewing sticks. When freshly cut the sapwood is yellowish white, emitting an unpleasant smell, scarcely darkening when dry. The heartwood is pale brown when fresh, turning rapidly to dark red or orange upon exposure. The wood is extremely hard, heavy and durable, close-grained and of fine texture. It carves and turns well and planes smoothly. The wood is used for house posts, rafters, naves of wheels and utensils such as walking sticks, mortars, pestles, tool-handles and farm implements. It was formerly exported to Europe for turnery and cabinetry."@en .

Wild indigo is frequently prescribed, along with Echinacea, in the treatment of chronic viral infections or chronic fatigue syndrome. A decoction of the root soothes sore or infected nipples and infected skin conditions. When used as a mouth wash or gargle the decoction treats mouth ulcers, gum infections and sore throats.

The leaves contain a range of compounds including flavonoids, alkaloids, and glycosides. Various trials have been carried out into the health benefits of the leaves, particularly the hypoglycaemic activity. Whilst most of these trials have been positive, at least one was unable to discern positive benefits. The main plant compounds in the plant include astragalin, bauhinoside, beta-sitosterol, flavonols, flavonoids, glycosides, guanidine, heteroglycosides, kaempferitrin, organic acids, quercitrosides, rhamnose, and saponins. Astragalin has well-proven antibacterial activity. Kaempferitrin, a flavonoid, has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar levels, to have diuretic activity and to help repair kidney cell damage. The leaves are anticholesterolemic, blood purifier, diuretic, hypoglycaemic and tonic. An infusion is drunk regularly after meals for its health benefits, whilst it is also drunk specifically in the treatment of diabetes, high blood sugar levels, kidney and urinary disorders, to reduce blood cholesterol levels and as a general tonic and blood purifier.

It is then boiled in water and the liquid can either be used immediately or evaporated and stored as a dry soluble extract for future use. The mordants used (e.g. aluminium acetate, stannic salts, oxalic acid) determine the final colour of the cloth, which can vary from shades of red to pink, violet and brown. A yellow dye is obtained from the bark. The fruits contain tannin and were used in the past to prepare a black dye in combination with an iron mordant. The seedpods are used, like those of several other related species, together with protosulphate of iron, to make an ink or black dye. The leaves can be used to hasten ripening of fruits such as bananas and mangoes. A gum is obtained from the stem. The leaves contain a pleasant smelling volatile oil. The wood is straight grained with a fine to moderately fine texture, fairly heavy, hard and lustrous. It is difficult to dry and is susceptible to warping and collapse, but moderately easy to work; it takes a high finish, and is tough and resistant to termite attack.

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Agroforestry Uses: A good green manure crop. The plant has an extensive root system and is often grown to bind soil. It is also grown to provide shelter from the wind. It is also grown as a shade crop, cover crop, or as support for vanilla. Due to its hardiness, ability to grow on residual soil moisture, and slow early growth, this species is an ideal, non-competitive crop to plant with cereals. For hedgerow intercropping, the hedges should be cut at height of 50 - 100cm when the grain crop is fully mature. The hedges can be cut 2 - 3 times a year in areas where the dry season lasts 4 - 6 months. At pod maturity, the branches are cut at about 50cm. Higher levels of pruning can result in higher and unacceptable levels of plant mortality. The root system is reported to break plough pans, thus improving soil structure, encouraging infiltration, minimizing sedimentation and smothering weeds. Leaf fall at maturity adds to the organic matter in the soil and provides additional nitrogen. It seems to have special mechanisms to extract phosphorus from black Vertisol soils. The plant improves the soil through its extensive root system, nitrogen fixation and the mulch provided by the fallen leaves. Other Uses The stems are of use in basketry and thatching. The plants are often used as brooms. An essential oil can be collected by the steam distillation of the leaves and other aerial organs. It contains a mixture of compounds including the terpenoid alpha - copaene. The macerated leaves are used as a deodorant. The wood is used in light construction such as in roofing, wattling on carts, tubular wickerwork lining for wells and baskets. The dried stalks and branches are used for fuel. The sticks are an important household fuel in many areas. The heat value, with 1,450 kJ per 100g, is about half as high as the same weight of coal."@en .

The plant can be used to rehabilitate erosion-prone areas such as slopes and stream banks, and to recover land exhausted by agriculture, where it easily dominates undesired weeds such as Eupatorium spp., Saccharum spp., and Imperata cylindrica. It is used as a nurse tree for partially shade-tolerant timber trees such as Agathis species. The ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, high leaf biomass production and high yields of protein leaf material on less fertile soils make this species very suitable as a green manure and it is used in alley-cropping systems. Due to litter and the combination of a deep and well-developed lateral rooting system, the soil and productivity of the land is improved. However, the relatively high level of tannins present in its leaves slows the rate of microbial breakdown of the organic matter. It is compatible with crops, with both deep roots and extensive fibrous roots. It has shown promise as an understorey plant in coconut plantations with about 60% light transmission. The plant is suitable for hedgerow boundaries. The flowers provide a rich source of nectar for bees. Other Uses The pulp and papermaking properties are satisfactory and are comparable to dipterocarps and appropriate for kraft paper manufacture. The pulp is easily bleached, but wood dimensions are generally small, making handling and chipping difficult. A good firewood species because it is fast growing, multi-stemmed, easy to regenerate and thornless. The wood is suitable as a smoking fuel for the production of smoked sheet rubber. There has been a demand for smoking fuel since old rubber trees, the traditional source, are increasingly used by furniture manufacturers. The wood is also used to make charcoal.

It is an important cover crop for plantation crops, especially rubber and oil palm, where it is often grown in a mixture with centro (Centrosema pubescens) and tropical kudzu (Pueraria phaseoloides). Calopo grows vigorously, shedding a large amount of leaf litter onto the soil which smothers most weeds. The effect of calopo and associated legumes in improving soil fertility may last for 14 - 16 years. In an experiment in Malang, Indonesia, a green manure crop of calopo grown for 3 months contained about 65 kg/ha nitrogen in its leaves, shoots and roots. Calopo is a pioneer species: it provides soil protection against erosion, reduces soil temperature, improves soil fertility and controls weeds (Cook et al., 2005; Chin Chen Peng et al., 1997).

  :plant_medicinal_text "The ripe pods and seeds are widely used in both traditional and conventional medicine as a laxative. The root-bark, leaves and flowers also have laxative properties, but to a lesser extent. In modern medicine, the fruit pulp is sometimes used as a mild laxative in paediatrics. The fruit pulp and leaves are rich in anthraquinone derivatives (around 2%), and glycosides, which are responsible for the laxative properties. The fruit pulp is rich in pectins and mucilage. In-vitro and in-vivo tests have shown that the seed powder has amoebicidal and cysticidal properties against Entamoeba histolytica and that it could cure intestinal amoebiasis of humans. The aqueous fraction of the pods has produced a significant decrease in glycaemia. Aqueous and methanolic bark extracts have shown significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. An alcohol extract of the leaves has shown antibacterial activity in vivo against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus accelerated wound healing. A water extract of the leaves has shown antifungal activity against the human skin pathogens Trichophyton spp., Epidermatophyton floccosum and Microsporum ferruginum. The pods are used as a remedy for malaria, blood poisoning, anthrax, diabetes and dysentery. The pods contain a sweet, sticky pulp. A decoction of this is taken as a cure for kidney stones, as a vermifuge and as a laxative. The pulp is extracted from the pods by bruising them and then boiling them in water, after which the decoction is evaporated. It may be obtained from fresh pods by opening them at the sutures and removing the pulp with a spatula. The pulp is apt to become sour if long exposed to the air, or mouldy if kept in a damp place. The heartwood is traditionally applied as an anthelmintic. A decoction of the roots is applied to purify wounds and ulcers. In India the roots are used to treat fevers. The concentration of sennoside in the leaves of Cassia fistula is highest soon after the onset of the rainy season, when new leaves have appeared and flowering started. The sennoside content of the pods is highest at the mid-stage of fruit maturation, when the pods are pale brown."@en ;

Since it is not palatable to domestic animals, it may be suitable for the reforestation of areas which have become overgrazed. Other Uses The bark is used for tanning and dyeing. The seeds of Cassia fistula are a potential commercial source of seed gum, a potential binder for the pharmaceutical industry. The water soluble gum isolated from the seeds has been evaluated for its binding properties for formulations of tablets. The gum showed overall superiority in viscosity and binding properties as compared to other binders. The heartwood is yellow; it is distinctly demarcated from the white sapwood. The wood is reddish. The grain is straight to slightly interlocked; the texture moderately coarse; the wood is hard, heavy, strong and durable. It provides a hard multipurpose timber that can be used for buildings, carts, fence posts, agricultural implements etc. The wood is used to make a good quality charcoal.

There has been some research into the medically active substances in the plant and several compounds have been identified including calcium oxalate, flavones), an anthraquinone and tannins. The purgative action of the plant can be ascribed to the anthraquinones. The flavones cause diuresis and have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. An assay for antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 showed that extracts had a significant activity against this virus. Leaf extracts were found to be active against Staphylococcus lutea, Mycobacterium phlei, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus sp., but not against Staphylococcus albus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The entire plant is purgative and diuretic. An infusion is given against all children?s diseases. Powder of different plant parts is applied to teeth to cure toothache; when mixed with butter it is used to treat skin diseases. An infusion of the leaves sweetened with honey is taken against stomach-ache, ulcers and diarrhoea. A steam bath of leafy twigs boiled in water is prescribed to help against malaria attacks and fever; the liquid should also be drunk. Boiled and squeezed fresh leaves are applied as poultice in pleurisy or burns. Gonorrhoea in women is treated by taking leaf powder with food. The twigs are used to treat sleeping sickness. The roots, boiled in water, are used to treat haemorrhoids, bilharzia, leprosy, dropsy and bloody dysentery. In large doses it is used to treat intestinal worms including tapeworms, although this is risky. A pinch of powdered dried decorticated roots, taken at the end of each meal, is said to prevent malaria. After soaking the roots in water, the liquid is used for a bath against tiredness and for body massage. Crushed roots are rubbed on the temples to treat headache.

Where feed sources are limited it can serve as a high quality supplement to lower quality feeds such as crop residues and native pasture plants. Integrating Round-leaf Cassia into feed can result in healthy weight gains in cattle. Nutritional value as good as Medicago sativa in rat-feeding trials.  Good protein and digestibility levels recorded under grazing.  Application of deficient P and S in southern Queensland increased N concentrations of leaf tips to 3.3% N. Wynn' cassia raised N concentrations of companion native grass (Heteropogon contortus ) by 20-40% under grazing and fertilising (with P & S). Palatability/acceptability . Generally not eaten readily by cattle in the growing season under higher rainfall conditions, but becomes more acceptable as the associated grasses mature later in the season.  Can comprise up to 20% of diet in late autumn. Little apparent problem with 'Wynn' cassia in drier areas (<900 mm) but late maturing, tall types can be rejected by stock.  Not eaten by horses. Dry Matter yields of up to 7,000 kg/ha recorded in south-east Queensland, Australia . The nitrogen-fixing plant also acts as green fertilizer and has potential to increase crop yields either directly by increasing soil fertility or indirectly through application of higher quality manure from animals on farm land which eat the legumes. It can be applied in several ways: in pastures, fodder banks, and on fallow land to replace previously existing plant species, as well as amongst fruit trees or intercropped in rows with cereal crops. These are good methods of no-till agriculture, which has proven in many instances to contribute to better and more sustainable farming."@en .

As a fodder crop tagasaste delivers between 23 and 27% crude protein (14â30% in Western Australia) and 18â24% crude indigestible fibre. With proper application of fertiliser it can maintain these levels even when grown on poor soils.  Usually after a 10-24 months establishment period, tagasaste can be grazed by different ruminant species, including cattle, sheep, goats and alpacas (Orwa et al., 2009; Cook et al., 2005; O'Donoghue, 2011). Animals can graze down to a height of 20-30 cm (i.e. 70-80% of the leaves). After the first grazing period, vigorous regrowth occurs. This should be pruned so that tagasaste plants do not grow beyond 1-2 m high and remain available to livestock (Esterhuizen et al., 2016; Cook et al., 2005; George et al., 2003).  As a Nitrogen fixing legume it improves the nitrogen status of the soil, benefiting neighbouring grasses. Its extensive root system taps nutrients and water deep in the soil (down to 10 m) and makes them available in the upper layers for shallower rooting neighbouring plants. One of the first trees to flower in spring and it is an excellent nectar source for bees. Timber and fuelwood; it produces a fairly dense wood, useful for woodturning, and has excellent potential as a firewood crop as it coppices readily. Windbreaks; when mature as a close-planted 25-50 cm hedge it provides shelter from cold winds and summer heat. It can be used to underplant pine windbreaks that have developed gaps with age. Alley Cropping; it has potential as an intercrop in temperate orchards and as a nurse crop for frost sensitive trees. Tagasaste has been assessed for salinity control: it reduces water runoff and seepage, and thus assists in reducing the rising water table effect (Eastham et al., 1993). However, it is sensitive to salinity, and growth is reduced in saline conditions (O'Donoghue, 2011).

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is useful in stabilizing dry, alkaline soils. It is listed as one of the tree species used in sand-dune stabilization in India. The ash is rich in calcium and potassium and is a useful fertilizer. A very shallow rooting plant, it can therefore survive on low mounds in wet areas, or under saline conditions as long as salinity in the topsoil is low. It thrives only where there is little competition from deep-rooting trees. The open crown casts little shade. In the heat of the day, in order to save water, the leaflets fold together and present the smallest surface area toward the sun, thereby reducing exposure of the leaf surface. This also prevents much shade from being cast. Other Uses: A small fibre is said to be obtainable from the bark of some trees. It is used to make twine. Tannin is obtained from the bark. The tree is the source of the resin Angola, or Congo, copal. Copal is a hard resin, obtained from various tropical trees, and mainly used in making varnish. Some trees yield no copal but ooze a clear yellow gum when the bark is incised.. The wood ash is high in lime (approximately 50%) and can be used to make whitewash. The twigs are used as toothbrushes. The dark-grey wood is hard, heavy, quite durable but difficult to work. It is used as mine timbers, fence posts, house poles, bridge timbers, railway material, carved ornaments, parquet flooring and furniture. Due to its great durability and resistance to termites, it is widely used for construction, tool handles and other implements. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal. An excellent firewood, burning with great heat and very little ash; it burns easily, even when green. However, the hardness makes it difficult to fell, chop or split."@en .

It was widely used by the native peoples prior to the Europeans reaching S. America and these uses were soon taken up by the Europeans. The resin is especially valued for its ability to counter mucous in the chest and genito-urinary system. The resin is an aromatic, stimulant herb with a bitter, burning taste. Both it and the bark are anodyne, antacid, antibacterial, antifungal, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, astringent, cytostatic, demulcent, digestive, disinfectant, diuretic, expectorant, mildly laxative, vermifuge and vulnerary. The resin obtained from the trunk contains a number of medically active constituents including 30 - 90% essential oils and unusual condensed tannins. The essential oil contains alpha- and beta-caryophyllene, sesquiterpenes, resins and terpenic acids. It improves the digestion, has diuretic and expectorant effects, and controls bacterial infections. Much of the clinical research performed to date has verified the traditional uses of copaiba. It has, for instance, been shown to be highly effective as a topical wound healer and anti-inflammatory agent. The anti-inflammatory effect is mainly due to the sesquiterpenes, particularly caryophyllene which has also demonstrated effective pain-relieving properties, antifungal properties against nail fungus and gastroprotective properties. The resin as a whole (and, particularly, two of its diterpenes - copalic acid and kaurenic acid) has demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria.

As well as producing high organic-matter yields, it can reduce the build-up of root-knot nematode populations. It is often grown as a cover crop and in rotation with tobacco, vegetables, dry grains, rice, corn, cotton, sugarcane, pineapples, coffee, and orchard crops. Other Uses A valuable fibre is extracted from the bark. It is used to make twine and cord; canvas and fishing nets; and paper and pulp. Sun hemp fibre has greater tensile strength and is more durable under exposure than jute (Corchorus spp), though it is not as strong as hemp (Cannabis sativa). The 3 main properties that make sun hemp an excellent candidate for paper-making are 1) good yields of bleachable sulphate pulps, 2) pulp strength properties that are equal to or greater than those of mixed southern hardwood pulp, and 3) length-to-width ratio of bast fibre that is greater than that of wood fibres. Stems are composed of two types of fibre - the bast and the woody core. Bast fibres, located in the outer bark, are much longer than the core fibres, but the widths of both fibres are similar. The proportion of bark in the total stalk by dry weight ranges from 15% to 20%. Sunn hemp fibre is used in twine, rug yarn, cigarette and tissue papers, fishnets, sacking, canvas and cordage. Fibre is stronger when wet; it is fairly resistant to mildew, moisture and microorganisms in salt water. Crotalaria juncea holds a relatively high fuel value and possible could be a good bio-fuel.

It is used in the treatment of febrile diseases, premature ejaculation, impotence, lower back pains, frequent urination, incontinence, bed wetting etc. It is also used externally to treat various skin ailments including leprosy, leucoderma and hair loss. The seed and fruit contain psoralen. This causes the skin to produce new pigment when exposed to sunlight and is used for treating vitiligo and psoriasis. The antibacterial action of the fruit inhibits the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculos. The fruit is gathered when ripe in the autumn and can be dried for later use.

Since broom causes the muscles of the uterus to contract, it has been used to prevent blood loss after childbirth. Use this herb with caution since large doses are likely to upset the stomach. The composition of active ingredients in the plant is very changeable, this makes it rather unreliable medicinally and it is therefore rarely used. This herb should not be prescribed to pregnant women or patients with high blood pressure. Any treatment with this plant should only be carried out under expert supervision.

The branches are used to make baskets, brushes, brooms and besoms. They are also sometimes used for thatching roofs and as substitutes for reeds in making fences or screens. An essential oil from the flowers is used in perfumery. Growing well on dry banks and on steep slopes, it is an effective sand binder and soil stabiliser. Broom is one of the first plant to colonize sand dunes by the coast. The plant attracts insects away from nearby plants.

The timber is slightly oily, exceptionally hard and very heavy, brittle and somewhat fissile. The heartwood is extremely durable and resistant to all forms of biological deterioration. The sapwood, however, is susceptible to fungal or insect attack. The dry wood is difficult to saw or plane; it blunts saws and cutters and cannot be nailed or screwed without drilling; it is, however, among the finest of all turnery timbers, cutting exactly and finishing to a brilliantly polished, lustrous surface, dry and cold to the touch. Other products made from the timber include carvings, turnery and marquetry to produce sculptures, musical instruments, ornaments, inlays, chess pieces, walking sticks, bearings and many other products. The main industrial use, long supporting an export trade from East Africa and Mozambique, is the manufacture of musical instruments, especially woodwinds. With its high density and fine texture, the wood produces a beautiful musical tone. It is stable, stands up to metalwork processes, and takes an excellent finish. The wood is used as a fuel and to make charcoal. Its calorific value is more than 49,000 kcal/kg. Heat generation is so high that fires of D.

The texture is fine, the grain crossed, lustrous in colour with a faintly fragrant smell. The wood is hard, heavy, strong, tough, and durable in contact with the soil. It is rather difficult to work, but takes a good polish. It is used for a wide range of items including knife and tool handles, musical and scientific instruments, inlay, jewellery boxes, rosary beads, chess pieces and steering wheels.

  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The heartwood is pinkish brown to purple with irregular black markings or zones, which are independent of the growth rings - these alternate dark and light bands give the wood an unusual and very attractively figured appearance. The heartwood is sharply demarcated from the 25 - 50mm wide sapwood, which is white marked with yellow vessel lines when first cut, but turning yellow rather quickly afterwards. The texture is medium; the grain straight to slightly roey; lustre is low to medium; the wood has no distinctive taste, but fresh heartwood has a rose-like odour which generally dissipates with age. It is this vanishing rose-like odour that is responsible for the name rosewood, not the presence of rose-like flowers as is commonly supposed. The wood is very hard and heavy; the heartwood is highly durable in contact with the soil, although the sapwood soon decays. Hardness makes this timber somewhat difficult to work - it is moderately difficult to saw and machine; it dulls cutting edges more readily than many other woods; ii planes well but must be held securely during planing to prevent vibration; it makes excellent turnings and finishes well, except, for some trouble with very oily specimens, but does not take a high natural polish. Because of its unusual beauty and excellent, technical properties, Honduras rosewood is highly regarded for a number of specialized uses Manufacturers of musical instruments use the wood for finger boards for banjos, mandolins, and guitars, and for percussion bars in xylophones and other similar instruments. Well-figured wood is used also in guitar bodies, mandolin ribs, harp bodies, piano legs, piano pilasters, veneered piano cases, and organ stops. Some of the best figured wood is made into veneer for furniture, cabinets, carpet sweepers, billiard and pool tables, and bank and store fixtures. Darker and more highly figured wood is often used in brush backs, jewellery trays, and jewellery cases. Rosewood is employed in the manufacture of high-grade carpenter tools, and in other items like canes, moldings, picture frames, and novelties, and is used to some extent for molding, trim and other interior work in boats and shipbuilding. The rosewood from Brazil is used extensively for the handles of knives and small tools. Honduras rosewood should be equally suitable for this use."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is widely used for sand dune stabilization and soil conservation. In India, it is recommended for shallow soils, arid western and subhumid alluvial plains and highly degraded calcareous wastelands. Owing to its strong capacity for natural regeneration, it has high potential for ravine reforestation and other soil conservation purposes on difficult sites. The leaves, rich in nutrients, are frequently used as a green manure. In the Sahel, particularly along riverbanks, it is said to improve soils A very effective hedge or barrier. Enclosures made with the plant prevent livestock and other animals from gaining entry to vegetable gardens, cash crops etc. However, since it is difficult to control due to its aggressive weedy character, the use of this plant as a live fence is limited. Plants can be an indicator of overgrazing in low rainfall areas. Other Uses The bark yields a strong fibre that can be used for various applications such as twine. The debarked roots are used for strong plaiting work such as for racks and baskets. A gum obtained from the plant is of low quality. The heartwood is red or dark purple with darker streaks; it is sharply differentiated from the sapwood, which is yellowish-brown with dark streaks. The grain is straight or slightly interlocked; the texture rather fine and even. The wood is medium heavy to very heavy, hard, durable and presumably resistant to the attacks of termites. Due to its generally small dimensions, its utilization is limited to making items such as walking sticks, handles, spears and tool handles. Fencing posts can easily last for up to 50 years. The wood is dense, burns slowly with few sparks and emits a non-toxic smoke, making it an excellent firewood. Because the tree often grows many small trunks, it produces wood that is ideal in size for carrying in a headload. This plant is fire-retardant Suitable for growing in containers."@en .

The texture is medium, the grain usually straight, with no distinctive odour or taste present in seasoned wood. In the green condition, angelique is similar to teak in most strength properties and clearly superior to white oak. It is about equal to the average for timbers of similar density in bending strength, elastic resilience, hardness, compression across the grain, shear, and toughness. It is above average in stiffness and in work to maximum load, slightly above average in crushing strength, but falls slightly below the average in tension across the grain and cleavage resistance. In the air-dry condition, angelique is superior to teak in all mechanical properties except tension perpendicular to the grain. It is superior to white oak in static-bending properties, compression parallel to the grain, and end hardness; comparable in shock resistance, side hardness, and compression across the grain; and inferior to white oak in shear, tension across the grain, and cleavage resistance. The working qualities vary according to the density and silica content but are generally rated as satisfactory. The wood finishes smoothly, splits easily, glues moderately well, and holds its place well under changes in atmospheric conditions. The wood is durable to very durable. The high resistance to decay and moderate resistance to damage by marine borers as well as its very good strength properties make angelique highly acceptable in marine construction for piling, poles, posts, and other similar uses where teredo are not a major factor. The wood is commonly used for construction purposes, bridge flooring, boat framing, carriage work, and crossties. To a limited extent, it, is also used for furniture, barrel staves, and parquet, strips and blocks. Because of small radial shrinkage, quartersawn material is considered suitable for flooring and for boat decks, frames, planking and millwork, general building construction, and agricultural implements."@en .

The texture is fine; lustre medium; the grain irregular to often interlocked; no distinctive taste but a faint vanilla-like or rancid odour; a waxy or oily feel is also a characteristic of the wood. It is an extremely hard and heavy wood, similar to lignum vitae (Guaiacum spp.) in this respect. The wood is also very strong, very dense, tough and very resistant to decay when in contact with the soil. It is difficult to work because of its high density and hardness; hard to saw and bore, but if sawn or bored clean edges and holes result; when severely interlocked grain is not present, the wood planes and finishes to a smooth surface; it glues poorly, as do many other woods of very high density, but takes a high polish. When unpainted wood is exposed to the elements, it weathers well as to surface smoothness and freedom from warp and checking. The wood is used extensively for cogs and shafts, heavy construction, turnery, fishing rods, paving blocks, barge and dock fenders, and flooring. The wood is particularly well adapted for use in tool handles, agricultural implements, sporting goods, and other uses utilizing its high bending strength and good shock resistance qualities. The somewhat oily nature of the wood and its hardness allow its use for bearings, cogs, shafts, and other uses in place of lignum vitae, where friction wear is a problem. It makes excellent wood for railway crossties and posts, for it is durable and does not split when exposed to the elements. This wood should also do exceptionally well as boat keels and frames, ice sheathing, industrial flooring, and specialty items requiring a strong durable wood.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Often planted as a shade tree in cocoa and coffee plantations in Central America and less frequently in Southeast Asia. The tree is a pioneer species, germinating in open land and creating the right habitat for forest trees to grow. The feasibility of using it in reforestation projects in the tropics as a nurse tree for other tree species is an alternative that can be explored. It has been observed that cocoa trees planted near this species produce more pods than those growing farther away from the shade trees. This is attributed to increased litter fall in plantations with this species, which adds to the available amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil. The tree is occasionally used in live fences although much less commonly than E. berteroana and other Erythrina species. It is also used as a support for black pepper vines and vanilla plants. The tree is planted as a hedge. Where rainfall is irregular and sometimes below 1,000 mm per year, this species has been noted to persist in prolonged drought without losing its leaves, recirculating nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from prunings. It is therefore a promising species for agroforestry systems in such areas where it would be intercropped with maize and cassava. Other Uses: The presence of ant-repellent compounds in the nectar has been reported. The heartwood is light yellow to yellowish brown. It is light in weight, moderately soft, weak, not durable, and scarcely suitable for lumber. It is used for making canoes and for carving. Farmers occasionally use the dry branches as fuel wood, despite claims that the branches do not burn well and produce a lot of ash. It is used more because it is available rather than because it is preferred."@en .

The tree is commonly planted in plantations such as coffee, pepper and cacao, often in combination with Cordia alliodora. It is planted as a shade tree in cacao plantations in the humid tropics, where it conserves soil and contributes to high and sustainable cacao yields. The tree is valued for its high production of green manure and mulch; the ease with which shade can be adjusted to the requirements of the main crop; and its ability to tolerate regular coppicing for many years. The green leaves contain 4.1 - 4.9% nitrogen, which makes it an excellent species for green manure production. Production of nitrogen-rich litter is abundant, and the nitrogen supply in litter fall exceeds several times the export of nitrogen in the cacao harvest. The nitrogen supplied through pruning residues left on the ground fulfils recommended nitrogen application rates. For alley cropping, the tree should be planted in dense hedgerows (1 - 2 metres between trees), with wide alleys (6 - 8 metres) between tree rows. High and sustainable bean yield in the alley-cropping system has been observed. In Costa Rica, alley cropping with this species has sustained 2 maize crops per year over 8 years without fertilization. Coffee and cacao may also be planted together with the trees. Other Uses The whitish to yellowish heartwood is not clearly demarcated from the sapwood. It is thick-textured, straight-grained, light in weight, soft, with poor mechanical properties and of low durability. It is only used for low value items such as crates, pencils, toothpicks and as a raw material for hardboard.

  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark of the tree has long been used for medicinal purposes by indigenous peoples in Brazil, especially as a natural sedative. It has been used to calm an overexcited nervous system and promote a restful sleep. The active compounds in the tree have been studied extensively; they have been found to comprise large amounts of novel flavonoids, triterpenes, and alkaloids. Twenty isoquinoline alkaloids have been documented for this tree. Many of these have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, cardioactive, narcotic, and sedative activities. One of these alkaloids, ?cristamidine? has been shown to have a positive effect on the liver. Other alkaloids have shown hypotensive and heart-regulatory activities. The alkaloid ?erysodine? has been documented with neuromuscular effects characteristic of curare arrow poisons. Two studies also indicate that it might be useful as an anti-nicotine drug, as it demonstrated actions as a competitive antagonist and to block nicotine receptors. The traditional use of the plant to relieve anxiety and stress has been validated by researchers in a 2002 study, where it was shown that a water-alcohol extract of the plant altered anxiety-related responses. The effect was similar to the commonly-prescribed anti-anxiety drug diazepam. It was suggested in this study that the alkaloids in Erythrina 'may alter GABAergic neurotransmission.' GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain; abnormalities with its function is implicated in diseases including epilepsy, anxiety, and depression. Further research has validated the traditional use of the plant as an antimicrobial agent for throat and urinary infections, it having demonstrated antibacterial activity in two studies against Staphylococcus aureus, and antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Positive regulatory effects on heart palpitations and decreased blood pressure have been reported. The bark is antispasmodic, antitussive, calmative and narcotic. It is considered to be an excellent sedative to calm agitation and nervous coughs and to treat other nervous system problems, including insomnia and anxiety. It also is widely used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, gingivitis, hepatitis, inflammation of the liver and spleen, intermittent fevers, and to clear obstructions in the liver. It is also used in some areas as part of the treatment for epilepsy. It is also used to quiet hysteria from trauma or shock, as a mild, hypnotic sedative to calm the nervous system, to treat insomnia and promote healthy sleeping patterns (by sedating overactive neurotransmitters), to regulate heart palpitations, and to treat hepatitis and liver disorders.; Dr. Donna Schwontkowski, a chiropractor who has used Amazonian plants in her practice, recommends the bark for treating hernias, stomachaches, and epilepsy - and to help augment milk flow as well."@en ;

In the Western world, bark extracts were used in the late 19th century to treat heart failure. Side effects and better results with digitoxine ended this practice. Used externally, the crushed bark is applied to swellings caused by Filaria. The dried powdered bark is taken as a snuff to cure headache. A decoction of the roots and bark is applied to soothe general body pain. Research has shown the presence of various medically active substances in the plant, especially alkaloids. The alkaloid content of bark ranges from 0.3% to 1.5%. This varies with the age of the tree: a water extract of the bark contained 0.5% and 0.9% respectively in 60 year- and 150 year-old trees. The bark extract has excellent local anaesthetic activity on eyes and skin, although its use on the eye was disputed because of its irritant effect on the conjunctiva. Trials using it as anaesthetic in operations or tooth extractions were less successful, as symptoms of poisoning appeared in higher doses. The alkaloids have a stimulant effect on the heart similar to that of the cardenolides digitoxine (from Digitalis) and ouabain (from Strophanthus gratus), but the effect is very short-lasting, as the alkaloids are rapidly metabolized in the organism.

The alkaloids also have strong diuretic effects, and increase contractions of the intestine and uterus. Norcassamidine has local anaesthetic action, and is a convulsant. The bark further contains procyanidins (polyphenols) and hence has antioxidant properties. The relaxant effect of the bark extract of Erythrophleum suaveolens is due to its procyanidins. The bark also contains the trihydroxystilbene resveratrol. Resveratrol shows antiplatelet aggregation, coronary vasodilator, antileukaemic, antifungal and protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitory activities. Trihydroxystilbenes are thought to protect against atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Resveratrol is, however, only registered as a food supplement, not as a medicine. The bark contains the flavone luteolin that colours orange after addition of magnesium powder and a few drops of hydrochloric acid. This reaction allows it to be distinguished from the bark of Erythrophleum africanum, which colours violet after treatment because of the presence of 2,3-dihydroxymyricetin.

Its spreading root system offers excellent protection to the soil along the banks of watercourses. Bacteria on its roots fix atmospheric nitrogen, whilst it also sheds its leaves in the rainy season; therefore boosting the nutrient status of the soil for the new season?s crops. The fact that the tree is leafless during the rainy season minimizes competition for sunlight with crops and protects them from birds until harvest time. It is commonly intercropped with annual crops, especially pearl millet and groundnuts. Yields of millet are much higher under a canopy of this tree; increases of 50 - 150% having been recorded. Results for sorghum, cotton, groundnut and maize are variable and either positive or negative, depending on the study. The effect may depend on soil fertility - when this is high, the tree competes with the crops. The tree is maintained and protected on farms in order to shade coffee and to provide shade during the dry season. The plant has been recommended for integration with maize as an alternative to Leucaena leucocephala. Other Uses A gum arabic, called 'Gomme de Senegal', is obtained from the stems. The bark is used to clean the teeth, as it is believed to contain fluorine. The bark contains 20 - 28%f tannins. The wood is burnt and used as a source of potash when making soap. The heartwood is pale and creamy; the brown sapwood slightly paler than the heartwood. The wood is hard, of medium weight. It is susceptible to staining fungi and pinhole borer when green; therefore, it is left to soak for several months to remove sap and minimize attack by fungi, borers and termites. Even after the most careful seasoning, the boards tend to spring and twist one or two hours after they are sawn. The wood works fairly easily by hand, but a smooth finish is difficult to obtain. Care must be taken when nailing, bolting and joining. It is used to make utensils, handicrafts, canoes, furniture, boxes, drums and oil presses. The wood is an excellent fuel. The calorific value is estimated at 19.741 kJ/kg of dry wood. It is used to make a high quality charcoal. Charcoal yields are as low as 17%."@en .

The tree is extensively planted in Southeast Asia as a shade and nurse crop for coffee, cocoa, tea, other crops and young timber plantations. Its fast growth and good shading properties outweigh the disadvantages of its sensitivity to strong winds and its relatively short life. Plantations have been established even on tailings left after tin mining. It is planted extensively for reforestation and reforestation of denuded and eroding land. The natural drop of leaves and small branches contributes nitrogen, organic matter and minerals to upper layers of soil. The plant's extensive root system further improves soil conditions by breaking up soils to provide channels for drainage and aeration. Other Uses: The bark has tanning properties. The heartwood is a light brown with a slight pinkish or yellowish tinge; it is not clearly demarcated from the sapwood. The texture is rather coarse; the grain usually deeply interlocked; sometimes lustrous; dried material is free of any distinctive odour or taste.

It dries rapidly with little or no degrade; once dry it is fairly stable in service. The wood is reported to dull cutters rather quickly; fuzzy grain is rather common because of tension wood; it saws well, but growth stresses often cause pinching of the blade; sharp tools are required to cut the soft wood cleanly. The comparatively soft timber is suitable for general utility purposes, such as light construction, furniture, cabinet work, lightweight packing materials and pallets, and chopsticks. Because the wood is fairly easy to cut, it is also suitable for wooden shoes, musical instruments, toys and novelties, forms and general turnery. It is an important source of veneer and plywood and is very suitable for the manufacture of particleboard, wood-wool board and hardboard and has recently been used for block board. The trees coppice fairly well, an advantage for pulpwood production. The wood is suitable for pulping and papermaking. It can be used to produce good-quality pulp by mechanical, semi-chemical or chemical processes. Because of its light colour, only a little bleaching is required to achieve good white paper. The neutral, semi-chemical process produces pulp with excellent strength properties. It has also been used for the manufacture of viscose rayon.

Used as a cover and shade crop in young plantations of cocoa, sisal, coffee, banana, plantain, oil palm and rubber; it also acts as a good windbreak. The plant provides mulch for associated food crops. Owing to the slow decomposition of the leaves, the mulch has long-term effects in weed control, moisture conservation and reduction of soil temperature. Flemingia mulch forms a relatively solid layer that effectively prevents germination of weed seeds or stunts their early development for 100 days. It is grown in hedges; promising when used as a live fence. In Malaysia, it is a useful bush to plant with creeping legumes, as it provides support for them to climb on and is deep rooting. It is grown in alley-cropping systems, used in pineapple plantations to control nematode infestation. Grown as an understorey for the Honduras pine (Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis). Useful as a cover crop in perennial plantations. Other Uses: One of the sources of the Arab dye called ?waras? or ?warrus?. It is a coarse purple or orange-brown powder consisting of the glandular hairs rubbed from dry Flemingia fruit; capable of dying silk but not wool or cotton, the active component is called flemingin. The powder is used in India, the Arab world and in Africa (e.g. in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Malawi), mainly for dyeing silk and cotton a golden-yellow, but also for other purposes such as dyeing bamboo for baskets and making coloured ink. It is also used as a cosmetic by placing a small portion of the powder in the palm of the hand and moistening it with water; the hands are then rubbed together, producing a lather of a bright gamboge colour, which is applied as required. To prepare the dye, the powder is dissolved in the dye bath with an equal weight of sodium carbonate. When the temperature of the bath reaches 40?c the yarns or textiles to be dyed are put into the bath and the whole is slowly heated to boiling point. To make the colour brighter, the fibre can be washed in slightly acidic water, e.g. made with lemon juice. Beautiful deep yellow or orange colours can be obtained, fast to light and acids, less so to alkaline substances. Those colours were used very frequently in combination with indigo blue in the renowned ikat textiles from Yemen. Fuel wood is a valuable by-product."@en .

The plant contains galegine, an alkaloid that strongly reduces blood sugar levels which make it useful in the treatment of diabetes. The leaves and flowering tops are diaphoretic, diuretic, galactogogue and hypoglycaemic. It has also been used in the treatment of fevers. It is taken internally to treat insufficient lactation, late-onset diabetes, pancreatitis and digestive problems, especially chronic constipation caused by a lack of digestive enzymes.

  :plant_other_use_text "Small flowering tree, Specimen, Living fence posts, Agricultural shade, Land stabilization, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: Gliricidia is a pioneer species that readily colonises open ground and is used for reclaiming Imperata grasslands. It is widely cultivated as a shade tree for perennial crops such as tea, coffee and cocoa. It is also used as a nurse tree for shade-loving species. Attributes contributing to its value as a shade tree include its fine, feathery foliage giving light shade, and the ability to withstand repeated pruning and to resprout vigorously. When grown as a hedgerow in alley cropping, it serves to suppress weed growth and control erosion and has been shown to reduce the incidence of disease in groundnut crops. With its ease of propagation from large cuttings, it is one of the most suitable species for live fencing around cattle pastures and for delineating boundaries. Its fast growth, ease of propagation, nitrogen fixing ability and light canopy makes it ideal as a live stakes. It has been used to support black pepper, vanilla and yam in West Africa and India. It has been planted to reclaim denuded land or land infested with Imperata cylindrica. As a green manure, gliricidia increases soil organic matter; it aids in the recycling of soil nutrients as it produces much litter. It also improves soil aeration and reduces soil temperature. It is a drought-resistant and valuable water-conserving species, because in the dry season it sheds most of its leaves, hence reducing water loss through transpiration. Other Uses The plant has found application as a rodenticide and general pesticide. The seeds are used as a rat poison. The roots are said to have a sweetish taste and to be deadly to the field mice and rats which invariably eat them in preference to those of cacao or coffee trees. The heartwood is dark brown, turning reddish-brown on exposure to air; the moderately thin band of sapwood is yellowish to light brown, turning reddish brown on exposure. The texture is coarse; the grain is irregular and close. The wood is hard, heavy, very tough, very durable in contact with the soil and termite resistant. It is difficult to split and takes a very good polish. The wood is utilized for railway sleepers, farm implements, tool handles, furniture, house construction and as mother posts in live-fence establishment. The wood is often used for fuel and charcoal production. It burns slowly without sparking and with little smoke, so it is an important fuel wood in the subhumid tropics. The calorific value of a 5-year-old tree is 4550 kcal/kg."@en .

Sometimes as much as a barrel of gum has been found around the roots of a large tree or at the site of a former tree. The gum is used mainly in varnish but also for incense and local medicines. The copal is also used for patent leather and in stains for tin ware. About 35 tonnes/year are collected in Brazil for local use. The thick bark is a good source of tannin. The bark was traditionally used by S. American tribes to make lightweight canoes. The hard, durable, tough wood is one of the best from the region. The heartwood is salmon pink to orange-brown when fresh, becoming russet to reddish-brown when seasoned, often marked with dark streaks; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 12cm wide band of white, grey, or pinkish sapwood. Texture is medium to rather coarse; grain mostly interlocked; lustre is golden; it is without distinctive odour or taste. The wood is heavy to very heavy; hard to very hard; elastic; durable, even in contact with the soil, being resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites.

Other Uses: The plant is a major source of the blue dye 'indigo'. The leaves and twigs do not actually contain indigo but colourless precursors that must be extracted and then processed in order to produce the indigo dye. The harvested leafy branches are placed in a tank containing water to which some lime has been added, and are weighted down with planks. After some hours of fermentation, during which enzymic hydrolysis leads to the formation of indoxyl, the liquid is drained off and then stirred continuously for several hours to stimulate oxidation of the indoxyl. Afterwards the solution is left to rest and the insoluble indigo settles to the bottom as a bluish sludge. The water is drained and after the indigo has dried, it is cut into cubes or made into balls. To dye textiles, indigo is reduced to a soluble form by a fermentation process under alkaline conditions. In traditional preparations of the dye, various reducing agents such as molasses are used, together with coconut-milk, bananas and the leaves of Psidium guajava. The alkalinity is maintained by adding lime. After the textile has been dipped into solution it turns blue when exposed to the air. The twigs are used for cleaning teeth."@en .

In Indonesia and Peninsular Malaysia it is used as a cover crop in rubber, sisal, oil palm and tea plantations; in Africa in coffee plantations. Its maximum effect as a green manure is reached when the cover crop is incorporated in the soil when still green and flowering has started. Green manure crops produce 4.5 - 25 tonnes per hectare of green material. In trials in Indonesia Indigofera hendecaphylla has produced a green matter yield of 3.0 tonnes per hectare 3 months after planting, containing 10 kg nitrogen and 3 kg phosphorus. After 6 months the green matter yield was 18 tonnes, containing 86 kg nitrogen and 21 kg phosphorus. A cover crop of Indigofera hendecaphylla controls erosion effectively on hilly and undulating land even under heavy rainfall, and is considered more effective than Clitoria ternatea.

In Sri Lanka for example, an increase from 3.7% to 5.3% in 4 years was found. Other Uses: The plant is a major source of the blue dye indigo. Plants contain the glucoside indican, which transforms into indoxyl (indigo-white) and glucose by enzymatic hydrolysis. Indoxyl can then be oxidized to the dye indigo-blue. It is perhaps just as well for Central America that the cultivation of indigo has largely been abandoned, since preparation of the dye was injurious to the health of persons employed in the industry. The freshly cut plants were immersed in large vats lined with bricks, such as may sometimes be discovered even now about Central American fincas. After fermentation had proceeded for some time, the plants were trampled by men in the tanks, after which the dye settled to the bottom of the water and was formed into small cakes that were later dried. Indigo was formerly much planted in some parts of Guatemala, especially in the Oriente and along the Pacific foothills and plains, and some is grown even today, for dyeing native textiles. The indigo-coloured coats and trousers forming the costumes of the men of certain highland towns are most distinctive. As late as 1883 it was reported that 135 quintales (hundredweight) of indigo were exported from Guatemala."@en .

A root infusion is used there as an antidote against snakebites and to treat insect and scorpion stings."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is sometimes grown as a cover crop and green manure. Indigofera tinctoria is useful as a green manure, it is used in India, for example, in coffee plantations and as a cover crop preceding rice, maize, cotton and sugarcane. In traditional rainfed rice cropping systems in the Philippines, this plant is a popular green manure, increasing rice yield whilst also reducing by 50% the need to supply expensive nitrogen fertilizer. The residue remaining after indigo extraction is also applied to the land as manure. Another reason to grow Indigofera tinctoria as a green manure is because it is a good nitrogen catch crop, reducing the amount of fertilizer NO3 leaching to the groundwater. Other Uses: A deep blue dye is obtained from the leaves. The leaves and twigs do not actually contain indigo but colourless precursors that must be extracted and then processed in order to produce the indigo dye. The harvested leafy branches are placed in a tank containing water to which some lime has been added, and are weighted down with planks. After some hours of fermentation, during which enzymic hydrolysis leads to the formation of indoxyl, the liquid is drained off and then stirred continuously for several hours to stimulate oxidation of the indoxyl. Afterwards the solution is left to rest and the insoluble indigo settles to the bottom as a bluish sludge. The water is drained and after the indigo has dried, it is cut into cubes or made into balls. To dye textiles, indigo is reduced to a soluble form by a fermentation process under alkaline conditions. In traditional preparations of the dye, various reducing agents such as molasses are used, together with coconut-milk, bananas and the leaves of Psidium guajava. The alkalinity is maintained by adding lime. After the textile has been dipped into solution it turns blue when exposed to the air. The twigs are used as toothbrushes."@en .

In trial experiments on cultivated slopes, a mulch from this tree reduced soil erosion to levels almost equal to those in secondary forests. The leaf litter is high in nitrogen, lignins and polyphenols. It is slow to decompose, but provides a long-term build up of organic nitrogen and effective weed control. Weed biomass decreased considerably in all agroforestry trials with this species, much more than with other leguminous species. Existing trials are too new to ascertain whether the species can maintain or improve soil fertility on acid sites in the long term, but results so far are promising. Other Uses: The heartwood is light brown with dark stripes; the sapwood is pale yellow or almost white. The texture is coarse; the grain straight to interlocked; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive taste or aroma. The wood is not very heavy; hard to moderately hard. It is said to be very durable, even in water, though another report says it has low durability and is susceptible to blue stain. It is easy to cut, saws slightly woolly and is liable to split in drying. It is used for making packing cases, and especially for making piles. The wood is used for fuel. A popular source of firewood, the wood has a high calorific value and burns with little smoke."@en .

The average total annual production of leaf fall is 8,789.4 kg/ha with a high leaf litter decomposition rate. Initial tannin content of the leaf litter is the major chemical factor inhibiting decomposition. High uptake of calcium from the subsoil and its enrichment in the surface soil resulted in higher soil pH under the trees. Other Uses: A brown dye is obtained from an oily substance present in the wood and bark. The bark is a source of tannins. The seed oil repels insects and has been used to protect stored products. It is said to compare favourably with neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts. When first harvested, the heartwood is yellowish, then it turns rust-coloured and in time assumes a dark colour resembling that of black walnut; it is clearly demarcated from the 5 - 8cm wide band of sapwood.The texture is rather coarse; the grain straight or interlocked.

It seasons slowly, with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is stable in service. The wood works well but has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct; the wood takes a very fine polish. The timber is highly prized in its local area, where it is used for heavy construction such as bridge making, power pole cross-arms, railway sleepers, boat building, house post beams and furniture. Other items made from the wood are walking sticks, food bowls, canoes and carvings. It is used in constructing the main hull, masthead, maststep and steering oar of ocean-going canoes. The small branches of felled trees are used as firewood. In former times the tree was considered sacred in Fiji.

The gum has been analysed and found similar to gum arabic, and of potential commercial value. Red, brown and black dyes are extracted from the pods, leaves and bark. The dried seeds are widely used for ornamentation. The heartwoos is a ight reddish-brown; the sapwood pale yellow. It is medium textured, close grained. The wood is strong, hard and heavy (about 800 kg/m), of medium density. It is easily workable for a wide variety of carpentry purposes and dries without splitting or checking. Sawn timber, mine props, furniture and parquet flooring are among increasingly popular uses. However, the use of L. Leucocephala for sawn timber is greatly limited by its generally small dimensions (usually not greater than 30cm diameter), its branchiness, which limits lengths of clear bole available and means wood is often knotty, and its high proportion of juvenile wood. Nevertheless, there is growing use of small-dimension sawn wood in a number of industries such as flooring, which might include L. Leucocephala in the future. Poles are used to prop bananas and as a support for yams, pepper and other vines. Use of short-rotation L. Leucocephala for poles is limited by their lack of durability and susceptibility to attack by termites and woodborers. The wood is commonly pulped for its fibre, used to make paper. The fibre values are similar to those of other tropical hardwoods, and it produces paper with good printability but low tearing and folding strength; the wood-pulp strength is greater than that of most hardwoods, with almost 50% greater ring crush. Its pulping properties are suitable for both paper and rayon production. Also used for particleboard production. An excellent firewood species with a specific gravity of 0.45-0.55 and a high calorific value of 4600 cal/kg. The wood burns steadily with little smoke, few sparks and produces less than 1% ash. The tree makes excellent charcoal with a heating value of 29 mJ/kg and good recovery values (25-30%). Addition of the ground wood to fuel oil for diesel engines was found to involve no harmful agents in the ash."@en .

However, although they are potentially harmful, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will normally remove most of them from the food. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish. Alfalfa sprouts (and especially the seeds) contain canavanine. Recent reports suggest that ingestion of this substance can cause the recurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus (an ulcerous disease of the skin) in patients where the disease had become dormant. The FDA advises that children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems should avoid eating alfalfa sprouts due to bacterial contamination. Avoid during pregnancy and lactation.

Plants are very deep rooting, descending 6 metres or more into the soil, and are able to fix large quantities of atmospheric nitrogen, this makes them one of the very best green manures. Plants are rather intolerant of competition from grass etc, however, and there is the drawback of needing to leave them in the soil for more than 2 years to fully achieve their potential. Alfalfa is a potenially excellent source of biomass. It is possible to produce more than 2 tonnes of protein from the leaves (suitable for human use) per hectare per year. In addition, the plant residues remaining could be used to produce the equivalent of about 10 barrels of oil per year. A yellow dye is obtained from the seed.

The gluing and varnishing properties are poor due to the presence of resin cells; the use of a filler improves the results considerably. The wood is highly valued for light and heavy flooring and for furniture. It is popular in the veneer industry, where it is used for decorative furniture. It is also used for joinery, panelling, cabinet work, doors, staircases, window frames, carving, turnery and musical instruments. It is suitable for heavy construction, ship and boat building, mine props, railway sleepers, vehicle bodies, implements, toys, novelties, precision equipment, boxes and crates, but for many of these purposes it is no longer used because of its high price."@en .

However, the wood is reportedly durable in fresh water, and is for that reason much used for making canoes in Lake Victoria. It air dries and kiln dries satisfactorily, with little distortion but with some risk of checking. After drying, the wood is moderately stable in service. It is easy to saw, but with some tendency to split due to growth stresses; it works fairly easily by hand and machine tools, but mortising and boring are somewhat difficult; a cutting angle of 10Â° and sharp edges are recommended for planing of quarter-sawn stock, but for flat-sawn pieces an angle of 30Â° is sufficient; the use of a filler is needed to obtain a good finish; it holds screws and nails well, but there is a tendency to splitting; pre-boring is recommended; it glues more or less satisfactorily and peels well. The boles have a tendency to split during felling operations. Freshly harvested logs are liable to insect attacks and should be removed from the forest soon after felling to avoid damage to the wood. The wood is used for tool handles, implements, carpentry, joinery, cabinet work, doors, door frames, bridges, boat building, vehicle bodies and fencing. It is suitable for light construction, flooring, interior trim, boxes, crates, veneer and plywood. It is used traditionally to make dugout canoes.

Dried fermented seeds keep for more than a year in traditional earthenware pots without refrigeration, and small amounts are crumbled during cooking into traditional soups and stews that are usually eaten with sorghum- or millet-based dumplings and porridges. Because of the savoury taste and the high protein and fat values of the seed, it is sometimes described as a meat or cheese substitute, but it is not usually eaten in large amounts. Dawadawa is rich in protein, lipids and vitamin B2. Parinari curatellifolia is deficient in the amino acids methionine, cystine and tryptophan, but fermented beans are rich in lysine.

Its use in the reclamation of Imperata cylindrica grasslands is being tested; in Indonesia and Malaysia, young trees planted in tall Imperata grassland and left untended after planting remained alive, but grew slowly. Due to a fairly high content of polyphenolic substances, decomposition of the leaf litter is slow, allowing a humus layer to build up in the soil. This slow rate of decomposition reduces soil erosion and also contributes to the suppression of weeds. Seeds of Imperata cylindrica hardly germinate in soil covered by the leaves. The tree has been used as a shade tree, mainly in coffee plantations. It is sometimes maintained after bush fallow as a shade tree for fruit trees and for its role in soil improvement. When unpruned, it provides a rather dense shade to control weeds during fallow periods, and can be managed in hedges without too much shading of inter-row crops. Because its growth rate is slower than that of Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium, it requires less frequent pruning. Plants can be pruned to form a dense hedge. Other Uses The heartwood is red-yellow to brownish; it is distinctly demarcated from the white-grey sapwood. The wood is heavy, brittle, rather durable though attacked by termites and boring insects. Another report says that it is termite resistent. It is used locally for planks in house-building, but is of little market value. The wood is utilized for the production of furniture, boards, posts, and wood pavement as well as in the building of houses and vehicles. The wood is used for fuel."@en .

It has been tested in rotational alley-cropping/fallow systems in Sumatra, where it shows promise. Young trees are often planted in an intercropping system with mahogany or Tectona grandis. A fast-growing tree that fixes atmospheric nitrogen, it has potential use for reforestation and is used as a source of green manure. It can be used for the reforestation of wastelands that are heavily infested with the grass Imperata cylindrica. The tree can be used as a hedge. Other Uses The bark furnishes a yellowish brown dye, which serves the dyeing of cotton and batik products. The bark has been an important component of the dark or black 'soga' dye in Java (where it is mixed with the bark of Ceriops tagal, the wood of Maclura cochinchinensis and other ingredients), which is used for batik work. The dye, derived from the heart wood, is applied in the textile industry. The bark contains 11 - 21% tannin, which is of the proanthocyanidin type. It is used for preserving and dyeing fishing nets. The wood and leaves contain smaller amounts of tannin. The sapwood is greyish-white, turning grey-brown on aging, the heartwood is light reddish-brown or black. The wood is moderately hard, moderately heavy, and somewhat lustrous, with a straight to interlocking grain. It is easily worked and is used locally for light construction purposes, boat building, cabinet making, sawn or hewn building timbers, wood ware, woodcarving and marquetry.

Other Uses The heartwood is greenish brown, turning dark brown to almost black upon drying; it is distinctly demarcated from the up to 25mm wide band of whitish to yellowish grey sapwood. The grain is interlocked; texture moderately fine; the wood is strikingly banded or shows a whorled figure; it is oily to the touch. The wood is heavy, very hard, very durable and resistant to fungi, termites and all wood borers including marine borers. It is also highly resistant to abrasive action and chemicals. It air dries very slowly but with little degrade, except slight surface checking. The rates of shrinkage are low; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood is difficult to saw and work because of its high density; it is rather difficult to plane and a cutting angle of 20% is recommended, but it has a smooth finish; it holds nails and screws well, but pre-boring is necessary; gluing, staining and polishing do not cause problems. The wood turns well; bending properties are moderate. In Malawi, where the wood is considered the most durable native wood, remains of hoes have been found that were at least 90 years old. Traditionally, the extremely durable wood is highly esteemed for making hoes and pestles, and for the rims and hubs of wagon wheels. Commercially, the wood is used for flooring and panelling, and it is also suitable for heavy construction, railway sleepers, mine props, ship building, vehicle bodies, fence poles, vats, interior trim, joinery, furniture, cabinet work, handles, ladders, agricultural implements, sporting goods, musical instruments, toys, novelties, precision equipment, carvings and turnery. In Zimbabwe it is one of the most important trees for poles used in local house construction. The wood is used as a fuel - it is difficult to light, but produces great heat and little ash. It also makes excellent charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses The heartwood is yellowish brown to greenish brown with darker streaks, turning dark brown upon exposure; it is fairly distinctly demarcated from the up to 3cm wide band of pale yellow-brown sapwood. The texture is moderately fine; the grain is straight, sometimes interlocked. The wood is moderately heavy; hard; very durable, but may occasionally be attacked by marine borers. It seasons slowly, with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately to poorly stable in service, It saws and works well with both hand and machine tools, although the blunting effect is fairly high and stellite-tipped saw teeth and tungsten-carbide-tipped cutting tools are recommended; it has a smooth finish; usually planes well, but sometimes with a slight picking up due to the presence of interlocked grain; it polishes satisfactorily, but the use of a filler is recommended; it is liable to splitting when nailed, but it holds nails and screws well; gluing does not pose problems when it is done carefully to prevent staining; the bending properties are moderate; it turns satisfactorily. Under moist conditions, the wood often stains dark where it is in contact with iron. The wood resembles that of teak, though it lacks the oily texture, and is highly valued on the international market. It is used mainly for high grade furniture and as decorative veneer, but also for interior and exterior joinery, stairs, flooring and boat building. It is also suitable for heavy and light construction, railway sleepers, vehicle bodies, interior trim, handles, ladders, agricultural implements, sporting goods, musical instruments, toys, novelties, boxes, crates, carvings, turnery and draining boards."@en .

When trimmed hard it makes an attractive if rather fierce hedge. When grown in hedges it is commonly mixed with other species such as Ziziphus mauritiana and Azadirachta indica. Other Uses A yellow dye is obtained from the bark. The bark contains about 25% tannin. The seeds and leaves are also sources of tannin. The wounded bark exudes a mucilaginous reddish-brown gum somewhat like gum arabic. The seeds contain about 20% of a greenish oil which, after refining and bleaching, can be used in the making of soap and can substitute kapok and ground nut seed oils. The heartwood is yellowish or reddish-brown; the sapwood yellowish. The wood is strong and durable yet soft and flexible. It is moderately hard and usually straight grained. It weighs about 590 kg/m_, is easy to saw and finishes to a smooth surface. Not of a very high quality, though it can be used in construction and for posts. The short spines and irregular, crooked growth make it less attractive for wood uses. Fast-growing and coppices vigorously but due to its smokiness and low calorific value (5 177-5 600 kcal/kg), this species is not of very high quality for fuel.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Because of its extensive network of lateral roots, and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, this is a preferred species for controlling soil erosion and binding sand dunes. Because it tolerates moderate levels of salinity, it is an ideal candidate for recovering a variety of wastelands such as saline soil reclamation. It is also used in reforestation of marginal land. Grass grows normally beneath the tree so it has been planted to provide shade in pastures. It is also grown as a windbreak and shade provider for tea plantations in Sri Lanka. The incorporation of leaves and the presscake into soils improves fertility. Decomposed flowers are valued in the tropics as rich nutrition for special plants, especially when grown in greenhouses. The leafy twigs are used for green manuring rice paddies, sugarcane fields and coffee plantations. The tree is used as a host for the hemiparasitic sandalwood, Santalum album. Other Uses The seed contains 27 - 40% of a thick, yellow or reddish-brown oil. The oil has a bitter taste, a disagreeable aroma and a specific gravity of 0.9371 at 15?c. It is used as a lubricant, varnish, water-paint binder and in soap making. The seed oil was formerly indispensable as an illuminant in lamps, but has been largely replaced by kerosene. Two kilos of mature pods will yield about 1 kilo of husked kernels. Extracted oil amounts to 13.4% of the whole seed pod; 26.97% of the kernels. The presscake, when applied to the soil, is valued as a pesticide, particularly against nematodes. In rural areas, the dried leaves are stored with grain to repel insects. The bark fibre is made into string, twine or rope. The roots yield a natural pigment called 'pinnatin'. The wood ash is employed in dyeing. The wood varies from white to yellowish-grey with no distinct heartwood. It is beautifully grained and medium to coarse textured. Although it is a moderately strong timber that is relatively easy to saw, turn and finish, the wood is not considered a quality timber because it is not durable, tends to split and warp during seasoning and is susceptible to insect attack. It is used for cabinet making, cartwheels, posts, agricultural implements, tool handles and combs. It is also suitable as a source of pulp for paper making With a calorific value of 4 600 kcal/kg, pongam is commonly used as a fuel wood."@en .

Some research has been carried out into the medicinal properties of the tree, much of which has confirmed the traditional uses. The bark exudate quickly hardens upon exposure to air. It contains 30 - 80% kinotannic acid, which is a strong astringent. Bark extracts have shown in-vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities against several human pathogens. In tests they blocked the ovulation and oestrus cycle through antigonadotropic activity. Moderate in-vitro antimalarial activity of the bark extract was also demonstrated against strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The effectiveness of the bark as a wound-healing agent was confirmed in tests, and the activity may be explained by the presence of phenolic compounds that have an effect on the immune system. The bark has shown significant antioxidant activity. Water and methanol extracts showed in-vitro inhibitory activities against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the latter being a causative agent of tuberculosis. The resin, known as kino, is astringent and haemostatic. It is taken internally to treat diarrhoea including dysentery, fever, gonorrhoea and intestinal worm infections. Externally, the resin is used to treat eye complaints, ulcers and sores. Decoctions or infusions of the bark or roots are used in the treatment of bronchial infections, toothache, dysentery, menstruation complaints, anaemia, gonorrhoea, post-partum haemorrhage, ringworm infections, leprosy, wounds, tumours and ulcers, and as an anti-emetic, purgative and tonic. Root preparations are administered as an enema to treat venereal diseases. Leaf decoctions are used to treat fever, syphilis and are used as an aphrodisiac."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A natural pioneer species in its native habitat, readily invading fallow land. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen, though is fairly slow-growing when young. The tree has potential for use as live fencing. The tree is the source of a good quality nectar for bees. Other Uses Kino, a red substance resembling resin, is obtained by tapping the heartwood. It is rich in tannins and can be used as a red dye and medicinally as an astringent. The heartwood is a source of a red dye, which is used for dying cloth, the body or hair. The dyestuff is pulverized and mixed with water, the cloth dipped and dried and shea oil or palm oil rubbed in to produce a dark purple colour. The bark is occasionally used for tanning. The reddish bark exudate ('kino') is beaten onto cloth with a mallet to give it a glaze. Decoctions of the leaves are used as insect repellents. The heartwood is yellowish brown to reddish brown, often with purplish brown streaks; it is distinctly demarcated from the 2 - 8cm thick, yellowish or pale cream-coloured sapwood. The grain is straight to interlocked, texture fine to moderately coarse; fresh wood has an unpleasant aroma. The wood is moderately heavy to very heavy; hard; very durable, being very resistant to fungi, dry-wood borers and termites; it is also resistant to freshwater organisms. It seasons slowly but with very little risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect and is rather difficult to saw and work, requiring considerable power; stellite-tipped sawteeth and tungsten carbide cutting tools are recommended; it finishes well, but picking up may occur in planing due to interlocked grain; it holds nails and screws well, but pre-boring is needed because it is brittle; gluing properties are often poor because of the presence of exudates in the wood, but the wood readily accepts stains and polishes well; it turns well, and the bending properties are moderate. The wood is highly valued for furniture and cabinet work, but is also used for heavy construction including waterworks, parquet flooring, stairs, implements, turning, sculpturing and sliced veneer. It is also suitable for joinery, interior trim, mortars, pestles, house posts, mine props, ship and boat building, vehicle bodies, sporting goods, toys, novelties, musical instruments (e.g. Balafons) and precision equipment. The roots are made into bows. The wood is suitable for fuel and is used to make a good quality charcoal. The charcoal is highly valued by local blacksmiths."@en .

The wood is moderately hard, moderately heavy, easy to work, pleasantly rose-scented, takes a fine polish, develops a range of rich colours from yellow to red, and has conspicuous growth rings, which impart a fine figure to the wood. Remarkably, such growth rings are developed even in the non-seasonal humid tropics. The wood shapes well, takes a high polish, and resists termites and rot. It is used for high class furniture and cabinets, decorative sliced veneer, interior wall panelling, feature flooring (including strip and parquet), musical instruments, gun stocks, rifle butts, turned articles, knife handles, boat building and specialised joinery. The highly prized Amboyna burl, one of the rarest and most valued wood products in the world, is marked with little twisted curls and knots in a manner more varied than bird's-eye maple. There is a distinctive sweet smell when working the wood. The more red the wood, the heavier it is, but an average density might be 720 kg/m_. It is little used for ornamental turning, but because the burl is so exquisitely figured, it makes a nice compliment to a piece to use it for finials or perhaps a cabochon-like inlay on a flat box top. Although the wood is not necessarily recommended as firewood, it certainly could be used for fuel. Some Pterocarpus burn green."@en .

For dye extraction, preferably old and hollow trees are cut from the forest and the heartwood is lumbered out. Often trees are felled and left for 2 - 3 years lying on the forest floor before taking the heartwood for dyeing purposes. The roots are also harvested for dye extraction. For dye production the heartwood is split into billets and chips which are dried and subsequently pounded into powder. A little oil is added to the pulverized material, which is moulded into cakes for stocking and for local sale. The heartwood is bright red when freshly cut, becoming orange-red on exposure and darkening to purple-brown; it is distinctly demarcated from the 6 0 20cm wide band of whitish to brownish yellow sapwood. The grain is straight to interlocked; the texture coarse; the wood has a faint aromatic scent when freshly cut. The wood is moderately heavy to heavy; hard to very hard; very durable being resistant to fungi, Lyctus beetles, termites and marine borers. It seasons somewhat slowly, but with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is stable in service. It is moderately difficult to work, having a fairly high blunting effect - stellite-tipped sawteeth and tungsten carbide cutting tools are recommended; it takes a good finish, but sometimes with some tearing of interlocked grain; slicing does not cause problems; nailing and screwing are good, but pre-boring is advisable; gluing properties are good. A valuable multipurpose hardwood, because of its resistance to water it is used locally to make canoes and because of its beautiful reddish colour it is favoured for carving and sculpturing, high class furniture, cabinet making, knife and tool handles, traditional hair combs, walking sticks and musical instruments. The wood has a high resonance quality as its damping of vibrations is low - in the past large telegraph slit drums and war drums, as well as xylophones, have been made from it. It is currently used also for ?Western music? xylophones and increasingly tried for the back and sides of guitars. Because of its high durability the wood is excellent for construction, carpentry, outdoor joinery, flooring, staircases, railway sleepers and boats but also for veneer, inlay, billiard tables, toys, joinery, dowels, shuttles, bobbins, spindles, sporting goods and paddles. As the wood is resistant to marine borers it was used in temperate regions for marine constructions such as piers and sluice gates. The wood is also used as fuel."@en .

Applied externally, the bark is used in the treatment of sores, skin problems, mouth ulcers, 303 etc. It is heated in water and mixed with figs then massaged on the breast to stimulate lactation. A cold infusion from the bark alone provides a remedy for nettle rash.. A decoction of the root is believed to cure malaria, blackwater fever and gonorrhoea. An infusion made from the roots is taken orally for the treatment of diarrhoea, bilharzia and abdominal pains. Roots are burnt and the ashes drunk in water to treat asthma and tuberculosis. Corneal ulcers are bathed in an eyewash obtained when roots of the tree are first cleaned and then left to soak in water for 6 hours. In the follow-up treatment of this ailment, flowers are placed in boiling water over which the patient holds the face, allowing the steam to fill the eyes Ripe seeds are burnt and the ashes applied as a dressing on wounds, inflammation, psoriasis and bleeding gums. The sap is reputed to heal sores, including ringworm sores and stab wounds, and to treat various other ailments Dropping sap into the eyes is used to treat cataracts and sore eyes.

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A nitrogen fixing plant, it has been used for soil conservation, dune fixation, live fencing and as an ornamental casting a light shade and with attractive fruits. The tree is regarded as an indicator of well-drained soils. Other Uses The heartwood of the roots, pounded to powder, yields a fast brownish red dye which is used mainly to dye palm-leaf fibres for basket weaving. Strips of palm leaves are boiled for about 12 hours in a dye bath containing hot water and the bark. After drying, the resulting red-brown fibres are used to obtain coloured designs in basketry weaving. The dye obtained by extracting finely chopped roots or wood in alcohol can be used to dye wool and cotton various shades of brown to bright red. The powder is also mixed with oil or fat to make a cosmetic pomade, which had great cultural importance. It is traditionally applied to all exposed portions of the body, including hair, face, breasts, arms and legs. It is also used to dye leather clothing, which is the traditional form of clothing for men and women alike and it still has cosmetic, medicinal and symbolic importance. The inner bark and heartwood of the trunk and branches are also said to be used by some people to obtain dye. The kino resin from the bark can be harvested by making incisions in the bark and collecting the exuding sap. The sap contains 77% tannins, and is used as a long-lasting dye. The inner bark is fibrous and is used in basketry. The tree shows considerable promise as a firebreak. The heartwood is pale to dark brown or reddish brown, often with streaks; it is distinctly demarcated from the pale grey or pale yellow sapwood. The grain is straight to interlocked, texture medium to coarse. The wood is relatively light, it dries well but slowly, without warping and with little or no tendency to check or split. Once dry, it is very stable. The wood works well with hand and machine tools, only moderately blunting cutters; straight-grained material planes and finishes well. The bending properties are moderate. The wood is easy to peel and slice, and has good gluing and excellent turning and carving properties. The heartwood is moderately durable; it is moderately resistant to termites and marine borers. The sapwood is liable to powder-post beetle attack. The heartwood is resistant to preservative treatment, the sapwood moderately resistant. A very valuable timber, it is a good substitute for Indian teak, which it somewhat resembles, although not so straight -grained. It is used for construction, carpentry, high class furniture manufacture (tables, chairs, benches), parquet flooring and veneer, and in South Africa and Namibia particularly for wood carving (bowls, spoons and walking sticks). Due to its flexibility, resistance and light weight it is also useful for boats, doors and windows. The wood is occasionally used for firewood."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: This species has been widely planted for shelterbelts and windbreaks, and is also used to produce woody biomass for energy production. It suckers freely, especially if coppiced, and can be used for stabilizing banks etc. It is used in restoration and rehabilitation projects because its extensive root system holds and stabilizes the soil surface, it sprouts vigorously and prolifically, it increases soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, and it forms a leaf litter that protects the soil. Its main use has been in the rehabilitation of former surface mine sites and for erosion control, but it is also used to rehabilitate contaminated soils, depleted soils, gravel pits, and logged areas, and to stabilize railroad embankments and highway edges. The plant is often found as a pioneer on old fields, burned areas, and lands strip-mined for coal. The leaves are rich in tannin and other substances which inhibit the growth of other plants. The flowers are a rich source of nectar. Honey produced from this nectar is considered to be of high quality and fetches a price premium. Other Uses:  A drying oil is obtained from the seed.  An essential oil is obtained from the flowers. Highly valued, it is used in perfumery.  A yellow dye is obtained from the bark. Robinetin is a strong dyestuff yielding with different mordants different shades similar to those obtained with fisetin, quercetin, and myricetin; with aluminum mordant, it dyes cotton to a brown-orange shade.  The bark contains tannin, but not in sufficient quantity for utilization. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 7.2% tannin and the heartwood of young trees 5.7%.  The bark is used to make paper and is a substitute for silk and wool.  The wood is close-grained, exceedingly hard, heavy, very strong (due to a high lignin content), resists shock and is very durable in contact with the soil. It weighs 45lb per cubic foot. It does not shrink much when drying. The wood is used in shipbuilding and for making fence posts, tree nails, flooring, furniture, woodenware etc. The wood of Robinia pseudoacacia var. rectissima, the so called 'Long Island' or 'Shipmast' locust, has a greater resistance to decay and wood borers, outlasting other locust posts and stakes by 50 - 100%. A very good fuel, but it should be used with caution because it flares up and projects sparks. The wood is also used for making charcoal. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch."@en .

Other Uses The bark is an abundant source of gums and resins. The tree yields a gum of inferior quality which could be used as a poor man's substitute for gum arabic. Pods can be ground up and converted to alcohol as an energy source. Yields of 1,150 litres of absolute alcohol can be obtained per year from 1 hectare. The heartwood is brown when freshly cut, turning golden-brown upon exposure; the thin layer of sapwood is a cream colour. The wood is light in weight; soft but strong; durable to very durable. It takes a high polish but is often very cross-grained, making it difficult to work except when green. With its rich dark-and-light pattern, the wood is highly prized for carvings, furniture and panelling. The wood shrinks so little that products may be carved out of green wood without fear of splitting or warping as the wood dries. In Hawaii, bowls and other craft products made from the wood are in such high demand that the local wood supply is supplemented by imports from Indonesia and the Philippines. A moderately durable wood, it is also used in boat building. The wood is very durable against rot and termites. The beautiful, high-quality wood is used for interior trim, crafts, boxes, veneer, plywood and general construction. The fact that S. Saman wood produces 5,200 - 5,600 kcal/kg when it burns, and that it regrows vigorously after lopping or pollarding, makes it a valuable source of high-quality firewood and charcoal. However, where there is a strong market for wood carvings, the wood is considered too valuable to be used as fuel. Carbon Farming - Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, crop shade, living trellis.

It is taken internally in the treatment of conditions such as dysentery, chronic diarrhoea and chronic catarrh. Externally, it is used as a wash etc to treat nose bleeds, haemorrhoids, skin eruptions, bed sores, mouth ulcers, sore throats, dental infections etc. When boiled, the wood and foliage of the tree produce a dark brown sticky substance known as 'catechu', 'cutch' or 'cachou'. This substance crystallizes upon cooling and has been an important article of trade in medicinal herbs since at least the 16th century, reaching Europe in the 17th century. It contains 25 - 60% tannins, 20 - 30% tannins, flavonoids and resins, and is valued mainly for its astringent qualities and is used both internally and externally to check bleeding and excessive secretions from the mucous membranes. In this form, the herb is subject to legal restrictions in some countries. The seeds have been reported to have an antibacterial action."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The bark is a rich source of tannins. A khaki dye can be obtained from the bark. The bark exudes a light gum of very good quality and is one of the best substitutes for gum arabic. Obtained from Senegalia senegal, gum arabic has a wide range of uses including as a food additive, medicine and mucilage in inks etc. A tannin-rich, solid extract, known as catechu, or cutch, is obtained from the heartwood. Catechu usually contains 55 - 60% tannins. Depending on the way of processing, several products for different purposes can be obtained from this material:- In India and Myanmar the dark 'catechu' or 'Pegu cutch' is used for tanning, often in a mixture of tan-stuffs. It is also used for preserving fishing nets and ropes; for dyeing cotton, silk, canvas, paper and leather a dark-brownish colour; and also as a viscosity modifier in on-shore oil wells. When dyeing cotton, the material is steeped for about one hour in a boiling solution of cutch, to which copper sulphate has been added. Afterwards it is transferred to a bath containing sodium bichromate. The dye is very fast to light, acids and alkalies. The crystalline portion of a concentrated decoction of the wood, called 'katha' or 'kath', is much used in betel chewing together with the leaf of Piper betle, and as an astringent for medicinal purposes. A third form of cutch is the crystalline deposit sometimes found in cavities of the wood, known in India as 'khersal'. It is used for medicinal purposes. After felling the trees, the bark and sapwood are removed, and the heartwood is converted into chips. In India the chips are extracted with water in extractors made of copper or wood, but vessels of aluminium and stainless steel are also suitable. After heating for about 2 hours, the chips are removed and extracted in a new bath of water. Then the extract is evaporated and cooled for crystallization to produce katha, which is separated by filtering. To obtain cutch the aqueous liquor is further concentrated in evaporators to a consistency at which it solidifies on cooling. In this way advantage is taken of the fact that cutch is soluble both in cold and hot water, whereas katha is only sparingly soluble in cold water. The heartwood is light red to reddish-brown, darkening on exposure; it is sharply demarcated from the yellow to yellowish white sapwood. The wood is very strong, hard, durable and is not attacked by white ants or toredos. It needs long seasoning, and is fairly difficult to saw. An important timber locally, it is used for poles, agricultural implements, wheels, household items etc. The wood makes an excellent fuel, and is ideal for making charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is utilized for green manuring (India). It is used for revegetating erodible soils and has proved very effective in reclaiming sodic soils which have been dressed with gypsum. Other Uses The bark yields tannin. The bark of plants 3 years old or more contains 15 - 24% of tannin on a dry weight basis. A black dye is obtained from the bark. A fast yellow dye is obtained from the flowers. The flower buds are used in the galling process prior to dyeing cotton cloth and chintzes red, pink or purple with madder roots (Rubia cordifolia L.). The boiled seeds are an important ingredient in indigo vats, where specific bacterial fermentation ensures the reduction of insoluble indigo into the soluble leuco-indigo, allowing textile fibres to be impregnated by the dye solution. The seeds serve as a source of sugars to keep the fermentation process going. A fibre is obtained from the inner bark. The bark fibre can be made into rope Branches are used as chewing sticks and toothbrushes. The wood does not reach a volume adequate for timber, but sometimes handles of small tools are made from it. A most curious use of the plant is reported from India. It is believed that branches were formerly used in the fabrication of wootz Damascus steel. They were added to the crucible and heated with the ore to obtain the chemical composition that gave the steel its beautiful patterning. Senna auriculata is suitable for landscaping roadways and home gardens. It tolerates drought and dry conditions, but not much cold. The flowers in racemes are also attractive. Industrial Crops: Fiber, Tannin, Dye."@en .

It is pruned into hedgerows and used as a live fence around food crops. When used as a hedgerow, it effectively increases topsoil infiltration, reducing runoff and combating soil erosion. The leaves are used as green manure, and a well-grown tree can yield 500 kg/year of fresh leaves. S. Siamea forms ecto-mycorrhizae and provides very useful mulch, especially in alley-cropping systems. It is used extensively for rehabilitation of degraded land, for example, to re-vegetate aluminium mine tailings. Although not a nitrogen-fixing tree, it has been increasingly used in alley cropping systems, largely because of its coppicing ability and high biomass production. In India, it is used as a host for sandalwood (Santalum spp.), a parasitic tree producing the well-known aromatic wood. Other Uses All parts of the plant can be used for tanning. The concentrations of tannin vary slightly from 17% in the leaves to 9% in the bark and 7% in the fruits. The heartwood is black-brown with paler streaks, sharply demarcated from the 6cm wide band of pale sapwood. The grain is interlocked and occasionally straight; the texture is slightly coarse but even. The wood is medium-weight to heavy, hard to very hard, resistant to termites, strong and durable. It is difficult to work, with a tendency to pick up in planing and it takes a high polish. The dark heartwood, which is often nicely figured, is used for joinery, cabinet making, inlaying, handles, sticks and other decorative uses. The wood has also been used for poles, posts, bridges, mine poles and beams. The dense wood makes good fuel, although it produces some smoke when burning. The energy value of the wood is 22 400 kJ/kg. The wood was formerly preferred for locomotive engines. Its charcoal is also of excellent quality."@en .

The plant has been used to provide shade in nurseries; for some plantation crops such as coffee, tea and cocoa; and as a windbreak for citrus, banana and coffee. It can be used as a living fence, as shelterbelt, or as a live support for crops such as vanilla and pepper. Crops continue to grow well when interplanted with this species since its open canopy allows sunlight to pass. Other Uses: Bark exudate and seed endosperm gums are produced. The clear bark gum is used in adhesives as a substitute for gum arabic. The bark yields tannins. The white wood is soft and rather light. The density of the wood increases with age, however, and the timber from 5 to 8 year-old trees can be used in house construction or as craft wood. The trunk has been used for poles but may not last long due to rot and insect infestation. The light wood is used in floating fishing nets. The wood is a major source of pulp for use in making paper. The fibres are short and they can also be blended with long-fibred bamboo pulp in suitable proportions in order to give good strength. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal. It is not highly regarded as a fuel because it smokes excessively when burning. Having a weight of only 500 kg/square metre, it burns rapidly without much heat. But the tree's fast growth and availability within a year of planting make it a locally popular fuel wood. The wood should be well dried, as it deteriorates in storage and becomes corky, dusty and unfit for burning. Its calorific value is 17.91 MJ/kg, with a high ash content (6%) and low percentage of carbon (11.7%)."@en .

It is fast-growing, short-lived, fixes atmospheric nitrogen, provides a large bulk for revitalising the soil, and has a wide range of uses. The plant has been used to shade plantations of coffee, tea and cocoa. It has also been used to provide a windbreak for bananas, citrus and coffee. The growing plant will increase soil nitrogen levels through symbiotic interaction with bacteria, it has the ability to stabilize soil, and in Asia has been used as green manure for rice. Its branches have been used as mulch and leaves as a green manure. It improves soil fertility in a short-term rotation fallow. The plant is also useful in combating the parasitic plant striga weed (Striga hermonthica). It stimulates the Striga weed to germinate, but is unsuitable as a host, so the Striga dies unless it can find another host nearby. Some studies indicate that a one year fallow with this plant can increase maize yields from 2 to 4 tonnes per hectare without the application of nitrogen fertilizer. It is a promising shrub for alley cropping because it is easy to establish, grows rapidly, coppices readily and provides mulch material of high nutrient content (particularly nitrogen). In some climates, such as in the highlands of Kenya, it may have a sparse canopy, and weed competition can be a problem. The trees are suitable for use as live trellises for growing pepper plants (Piper spp.) on. Other Uses Fibres obtained from the bark are used for making ropes and nets. It has the potential for pulpwood production. The saponin, stigmasta-galactopyranoside, which is isolated from the seeds, has glucuronide derivatives of oleanolic acid, which has been shown to have molluscicidal activity against Biophalaria glabrata, one of the known snail vectors of schistosomiasis. The seeds and bark produce a gum. The wood is used traditionally for making arrows, pipes, toys etc. A popular crop for firewood and charcoal because it produces a high woody biomass in a short time, which, although soft, is relatively smokeless, quick kindling and hot burning. The calorific yield for a 3-year-old tree is approximately 4350 kcal/kg."@en .

The texture is very fine; lustre good; the grain generally straight but may be variable; odour or taste is not distinctive in dry wood. The wood is extremely heavy, very dense, hard, compact, very strong, and resilient. It is variously reported as being very difficult to moderately difficult to work with either hand or machine tools, for it is a hard, high-density wood. But there is general agreement that the wood finishes smoothly, turns very satisfactorily (as do many other very dense woods), and polishes well. It takes nails badly and needs preboring for the use of nails or screws. The heartwood is generally reported to be very resistant to decay, but the sapwood, which makes up the bulk of the lumber produced, is not durable. The wood is rated resistant to damage by the dry-wood termite. The heartwood is one of the most attractive woods on the export market, it is used for inlay, walking sticks, bagpipes, parquet flooring, and bows, and is recommended as a substitute for ebony for it polishes to a high lustre. The whitish sapwood is used in some localities for implement frames and spokes of wheels; the heartwood for posts, articles of turnery, furniture, cabinetwork, and heavy and durable construction. The sapwood has been recommended as a substitute for hickory (Carya) for those purposes requiring very strong, tough, and resilient material. The wood should be well fitted for many other uses requiring a heavy, hard wood having high bending and compression strength, abrasion resistance, and durability."@en .

Leaf extracts exhibit anti-oxidant activity in the liver, and are a common ingredient in cardiac and blood sugar reducing medicines. Young leaves may be used in fomentation for rheumatism, applied to sores and wounds, or administered as a poultice for inflammation of joints to reduce swelling and relieve pain. A sweetened decoction of the leaves is good against throat infection, cough, fever, and even intestinal worms. The filtered hot juice of young leaves, and a poultice of the flowers, is used for conjunctivitis. The leaves are warmed and tied to affected areas in order to relieve swellings and pains, particularly sprains. They are also used for bathing sores or to bathe persons suffering from measles or allergies. The leaves and flowers are used to make a sweetened tea that is drunk by children as a remedy for measles. They were also used in a preparation which was drunk in early Guyana as a malaria remedy. A decoction of the flower buds is used as a remedy for children's bedwetting and urinary complaints. The fruit is aperient and laxative. A syrup made from the ripe fruit is drunk in order to keep the digestive organs in good condition, and also as a remedy for coughs and chest colds.

  :plant_other_use_text "Seaside. Large shade tree. Street tree. Public open space. Bonsai. Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: Tamarind is not very compatible with other plants because of its dense shade, broad spreading crown and allelopathic effects. It has been tested as an agroforestry species in India but although the reduction in crop yield is less than that with species such as teak, the spreading crown makes it little compatible with other species. The dense shade makes it more suitable for firebreaks as no grass will grow under the trees. The deep roots make it very resistant to storms and suitable for windbreaks. Other Uses The pulp of the fruit, sometimes mixed with sea-salt, is used to polish silver, copper and brass. It is normally used when the pulp is over-ripe. The seed contains pectin that can be used for sizing textiles. Ground, boiled, and mixed with gum, the seeds produce a strong wood cement. An amber coloured seed oil - which resembles linseed oil - is suitable for making paints and varnishes and for burning in lamps. Both leaves and bark are rich in tannin. The bark tannins can be used in ink or for fixing dyes. The leaves yield a red dye, which is used to give a yellow tint to clothe previously dyed with indigo. Sapwood is light yellow, heartwood is dark purplish brown; very hard, durable and strong (specific gravity 0.8-0.9g/cubic m), and takes a fine polish. It is used for general carpentry, sugar mills, wheels, hubs, wooden utensils, agricultural tools, mortars, boat planks, toys, panels and furniture. In North America, tamarind wood has been traded under the name of 'Madeira mahogany'. Provides a good firewood with the calorific value of 4 850 kcal/kg, it also produces an excellent charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: With its ability to fix large amounts of atmospheric nitrogen and produce a good bulk of biomass, white tephrosia is widely used in agroforestry as a green manure crop, to restore degraded land etc. Not only does it provide nitrogen, the plant also raises soil phosphorus and potassium levels in proportion to increased levels of organic matter. Soil structure improves, water-holding capacity and permeability increase, and soil losses caused by water erosion decrease. It can yield well on acid soils; for example, in Vietnam, green-matter content of the soil increased from 1.7 to 4%. White tephrosia is widely grown in mixed cultivation, for example with pineapple, maize and other annual crops, and it is said to improve the quality of tobacco. Cassava is a shade-sensitive species and needs regular lopped hedgerows, for which T. Candida is a very suitable species. It has been tried as an alley crop with cassava planted in 7-m-wide inter-rows. Preliminary results indicate a greatly increased yield of cassava and a considerable reduction of erosion. It is grown as a temporary shade crop in newly planted perennial crops such as citrus, coconut, coffee, rubber and tea. It has been used for rehabilitating degraded land. Suitable for making hedges along contours, around fields and home gardens, as it is not eaten by domestic animals such as buffaloes and goats. It is commonly used for hedgerows, providing mulch for different upland crops. Other Uses Powdered leaves are used as an insecticide. When the species becomes woody with age, it provides suitable fuel wood."@en .

It produces a new flush of leaves when the temperatures are highest and before the rains, when there is a great need for shade to reduce soil temperatures. It stimulates the development of an understorey of perennials, palatable and nutritious grasses (such as Cenchrus ciliaris, Panicum maximum) through providing them shade, fixing nitrogen and improving soil structure and infiltration. A pioneer species with a climax of 40 years, it occupies a successional position between the tropical forest and the bushveld. The long flowering season makes this plant a useful tree for apiculture. Bees collect both pollen and nectar from the flowers. Large specimens are an indicator of underground water. Other Uses A gum is obtained from the stems. It resembles gum arabic and is used regionally in southern Africa as a substitute for that gum. It cannot be exported to Europe or the USA because it has not been cleared for toxins. Annual production is 25-30 t/ha. The bark and seedpods are sources of tannins. They impart a reddish colour. The bark contains up to 19% tannins. The Nama people of southern Africa extract a red dye from the bark. The root bark is used for twine and rope (like in the traditional Nama mat house). The wood is hard, tough and moderately durable, but few trees reach a commercial size, thereby limiting its commercial use. It saws easily; planes to a smooth finish; glues and varnishes well - it is used for furniture and the interior finish of buildings. It is, however, likely to twist in seasoning and is susceptible to attack by borers and fungi. Kraft properties have been tested, and it pulps quite easily under standard kraft macro-pulping conditions. The wood burns brightly, with very little smoke and no odour. It splits easily and once dried does not absorb moisture from the atmosphere. It has calcium oxalate crystals that give its embers high temperatures and make them long lasting. These clean burning traits, ideal for cooking and heating, make it excellent firewood wherever it grows. In the coastal dunes of Zululand, South Africa, it is reputed as an excellent charcoal source."@en .

Other Uses A sticky red resin, known as Indian Gum Arabic, exudes from the bark. It is sweet, but of poorer quality than the gum arabic obtained from Acacia senegal. It is used for printing and dyeing calico, as a sizing material for cotton and silks, and also in the manufacture of paper. The gum is still used in making candles, inks, matches, and paints. It is also useful as an emulsifying and suspending agent. To harvest the gum, the trees are wounded by removing a part of the bark and bruising the surrounding bark. Good-quality gum is reddish in colour, almost completely soluble in water and tasteless. Usually it is traded in ball form. The gum obtained from the pods is used for dyes and inks in India. The bark and the seedpods are rich in tannin. The inner bark contains 18 - 23% tannin. The tannin content of entire pods can vary from 12 - 19% and from 18 - 27% after removal of the seeds. In Sudan the de-seeded pods can reach tannin contents of up to 50%. Seeds are usually removed because of their high content of sugar-like components which tend to cause the tannin liquor to ferment. The bark is used for tanning and dyeing material black or various shades of brown. Dried mature pods are used in local tanneries in Sudan and rarely in India to produce a pinkish-white colour. The tannins are used for dyeing clothes a yellow colour. The tannins are used as a source of khaki-to-brown dyes if used without a mordant, or grey and black dyes for cotton if combined with a mordant of iron-rich mud. For harvesting the bark for tanning, the trees are felled and the bark is separated from the logs by beating them with wooden mallets. The strips obtained are then sun-dried, chopped into small chips and sent to tanneries. The bark is often only a by-product; the trees are primarily felled for timber and fuel. An extract of the root is a potential inhibitor of tobacco mosaic virus. The aqueous extract of the fruit, rich in tannin (18 - 23%) has shown algicidal activity against Chroccoccus, Closteruim, Coelastrum, Cosmarium, Cyclotella, Euglena, Microcystis, Oscillatoria, Pediastrum, Rivularia, Spirogyra, and Spirulina. A fibre obtained from the bark of slender branches is used to make coarse ropes and paper. These slender branches and their fibres are also used for toothbrushes. The twigs are esteemed for tooth brushes (chewsticks). The heartwood is pale red, red-brown to deep red, often darkening upon exposure; it is distinctly demarcated from the yellowish white sapwood. The wood is strong, heavy, hard, durable, close-grained and resistant to water and ants. Very shock-resistant and harder than teak, it is used for making agricultural implements, sugar and oil presses, boat handles, brake blocks, cart-wheels, planks, tent pegs, etc. The wood shavings are used as raw material for pulping to make paper. The wood is valuable as a fuel and also for the production of charcoal. Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: tannin. Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, alley crop, windbreak. Fodder: pod."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plants root system makes it a good soil stabilizer. Other Uses: A gum arabic is obtained from the trunk. The gum (known as talha gum) is darker and inferior in quality to that of Acacia senegal (gum arabic). However, it forms 10% of the Sudanese gum exported to India and Europe. Talha does not meet the requirements of the food industry because it has not been toxicologically evaluated and contains tannins. For technological use outside the food industry, talha gum is attractive because of its clarity and solubility. The gum is mixed with soot and powdered Nubian sandstone for black and red ink. Pods and bark contain 20% tannin. The bark contains 18-30 % tannins and is a source of red dye. The smoke produced by burning the wood acts as a fumigant against insects and lice. Chemicals in the bark kill the freshwater snails that carry bilharzia parasites and algae growing in ponds. Methanolic extracts from the bark applied to ponds display algicidal properties. Molluscidal properties have been demonstrated with spray-dried powder of ethyl extracts, which are effective against schistosomiasis vectors Biomphalaria pfeifferi and Bulinus truncatus. The roots are used for making staves. The bark is used for making rope. The fibre has promising technological characteristics for use as particleboard. In many areas, farmers cut branches of A. Seyal to make fences. The thorny branches are good for this purpose and last about 2 years. The wood is pale yellow to medium brown, with localized pinkish-brown patches and some dark mahogany-red heartwood in larger or older individuals. It has potential in rural areas as timber. If the tree is grown with few knots and straight grain, sprayed with insecticide after felling, and treated with preservatives, the timber works well and is hard and tough. It produces a hard, dark wood, called shittim wood, with interlocked, irregular and coarse-textured grain. It takes good a polish but is susceptible to insect attack. Therefore, it must be properly treated by splitting it, putting it under water for a few weeks and then drying it thoroughly. Shittim wood was used by ancient Egyptians for pharaohs' coffins. Produces a good, dense firewood that is highly valued and is used widely throughout its range. The smoke is pleasantly fragrant and the wood burns rather quickly. In Sudan it is used to make a fragrant fire over which women perfume themselves. A. Seyal var. Seyal is an important source of rural energy as both firewood and charcoal.

It is the tree most recommended for reclaiming dunes in India and Africa. It has been grown successfully with Azadirachta indica in shelterbelts. Other Uses The pods have been used as beads in necklaces. The source of a resin called Gomme Rouge. The bark is reported to be a rich source of tannin. A strong fibre is obtained from the bark. A powerful molluscicide and algicide, the fruits are placed in fish ponds to kill the snail species that carry schistosomiasis, without affecting the fish. The thorny branches are suitable material for erecting barriers. The sapwood and heartwood are white and lustrous, with the heartwood aging to reddish-brown. Growth rings are distinct and separated by brown lines. The wood is moderately soft, not very strong, and is readily attacked by decay-causing fungi and insects. It should be promptly converted after felling and subjected to rapid drying conditions. The timber is not durable in the open but moderately so under cover. It is used for planking, boxes, poles, moisture-proof plywood, gun and rifle parts, furniture, house construction and farm implements. It is believed that Noah of the Old Testament made his ark from the wood of this tree. The root of this tree is traditionally used to make quivers for arrows. A piece of wood about 40 - 60cm long is placed in the spent ashes of a warm fire and left overnight. The next morning, a short section of the bark of the root is removed at one end; a circular groove is carved into the exposed core wood; a piece of wire is wound around the groove at one end whist the other end is attached to a tree; the bark (having already been loosened from the wood by the drying action of the warm ashes) is then simply pulled whole off the root. The core of wood remaining is then often used as a pestle. The plant starts producing fuel wood at the age of 8 -18 years, at the rate of 50 kg/tree. Its fast growth and good coppicing behaviour, coupled with the high calorific value for its wood (4400 kcal/kg), make it suitable for firewood and charcoal.

  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses The heartwood is dark olive to dark chocolate; it is clearly demarcated from the 18 - 30mm wide, cream-coloured sapwood. Numerous fine lines of parenchyma, which are initially lighter brown in colour but which eventually turn nearly black, make the wood unusually attractive. The texture is uniformly coarse; the grain straight to slightly roey; the lustre low; no distinctive odour or taste is present in seasoned wood. The wood is hard, heavy, dense and very durable in contact with the soil, being highly resistant to decay and insect attack. There are conflicting reports regarding its resistance to toredo attack in sea water, though it is generally considered fairly resistant. It is somewhat slow to season, with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It has a fairly high blunting effect, so stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; despite its high density, however, the wood is only moderately difficult to work and is generally said to have good working qualities; smooth surfaces are obtained in sawing and planing, but the coarse grain causes some rough and torn grain in boring and mortising; nailing and screwing are good so long as holes are pre-bored; gluing is correct for interior purposes only. The wood is used for making high class furniture, cabinet making, turnery, flooring, wheelwright's work, beams, general construction, joinery, panelling, railway crossties, posts, rising and gunwales of boats, and general construction."@en .
