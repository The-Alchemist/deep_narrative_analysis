# Annotation Properties
########################################################################

:antonym a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "A word which has an opposite/inverse meaning."@en .

:definition a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "Text providing an exact meaning for/the semantics of a concept."@en .

:example a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "Words/text that illustrate the concept/semantic being defined or whose instances would be specified as types of the concept/semantic."@en .

:negative_example a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "Words/text whose whose definitions do not support or whose instances should be excluded from the concept/semantic being defined."@en .

:noun_form a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "Oftentimes, concepts can be represented as either a noun or a verb. This property lists the noun forms of the concept."@en .

:sentence_structure a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "A sentence using a specific verb and identifying its arguments. For example, for the word, 'buy', a possible sentence_structure is '[[Someone]] buys [[something]].' The definition of a sentence_structure aids in the extraction of meaning from text, since it defines what other information should/could be mined from the text. Note that the arguments in a sentence structure are indicated by square brackets ('[[' and ']]')."@en .

:synonym a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "A word which has a similar meaning."@en .

:verb_form a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
  :definition "Oftentimes, concepts can be represented as either a noun or a verb. This property lists the verb forms of the concept."@en .

# Classes

:Collection a owl:Class ;
  :definition "A grouping whose members are defined using the :has_member property."@en ;
  :synonym "assemblage"@en, "assortment"@en, "compilation"@en, "set"@en, "compendium"@en, "accumulation"@en, "aggregation"@en .

:Mention a owl:Class ;
  :definition "A reference to an entity or concept that appears in an InformationSource. For example, the sentence, 'John Smith is the president of the company.' has Mentions of 'John Smith' and 'the president'. Both refer to the same person/entity."@en ;

:probability a owl:DatatypeProperty, owl:FunctionalProperty ;
  :definition "Decimal set on a predicate (an RDF* property extension) indicating the likelihood of the subject being related to the object using that predicate. A variety of objects SHOULD be related to the subject-predicate pair, where the probabilities for all the pairs should add to 1.0. In order to indicate the likelihood that the subject-predicate relationship is NOT applicable, the object is defined as owl:Nothing."@en ;
