:has_active_agent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has active agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who is an active participant (carries out some action) in an Event." .

:has_agent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who participates in or who experiences an Event or StateAndCondition. Whether the Agent is active in the event/state/condition or experiences/is affected by it can be distinguished by the sub-properties, :has_active_agent, :has_affected_agent or :has_holder." .

:has_affected_agent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has affected agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who is affected by an Event but does not actively participate in it." ;
  :example "For example, if a mob attacked a Person, then that event would be defined as an instance of an Attack (a subclass of Event) where the mob (a GroupOfAgents) is referenced using the :has_active_agent property and the attacked Person is identified using the :has_affected_agent property." .

:has_affected_resource a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has affected resource" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Resource ;
  :definition "References a Resource which is affected by an Event. This property is similar to the predicate, :has_affected_agent." ;
  :example "For example, if a building is defaced, then that Resource (a BuildingAndDwelling individual) would be identified in an AttackDamageAndAssault Event using the :has_affected_resource predicate." .

:has_destination a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_location ;
  rdfs:label "has destination location" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Location ;
  :definition "References the final location when an Event involves movement of persons, goods, information, etc." .

:has_holder a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has holder" ;
  rdfs:domain :StateAndCondition ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who experiences some StateAndCondition/situation." ;
  :example "For example, the general situation regarding Employment in a GeopoliticalEntity (such as a Country) would associate the Country to an Employment individual using the property, :has_holder." .

:has_holding_resource a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has holding resource" ;
  rdfs:domain :StateAndCondition ;
  rdfs:range :Resource ;
  :definition "References a Resource which is described by a StateAndCondition. This property is similar to the predicate, :has_holder." ;
  :example "For example, if a storage facility can hold x cubic feet of materials, then that Resource (a BuildingAndDwelling individual) would be identified as the 'holding resource' for an instance of the Capacity StateAndCondition." .

:has_instrument a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has instrument" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Resource ;
  :definition "References an inanimate entity (weapon, tool, etc.) that is/was used in an Event." .

:has_location a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has location" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Location ;
  :definition "References where an Event or StateAndCondition occurs/occurred." .

:has_origin a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_location ;
  rdfs:label "has origin location" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Location ;
  :definition "References the original location when an Event involves movement of persons, goods, information, etc." .

:has_provider a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has providing agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References the Agent that provides goods, information, ... when an Event involves movement of persons, cargos, etc." .

:has_recipient a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has receiving agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :Event ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References the Actor that receives goods, information, ... when an Event involves movement of persons, cargos, etc." .

:has_topic a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has topic" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  :definition "References the subject/topic of an Event or StateAndCondition." ;
  :example "For example, if there is an investigation of a crime, then the crime would be some subclass of Event (such as an Attack), and the Investigation event would reference that Attack using the :has_topic property. As another example, if a farmer has a large fruit crop that condition/situation would be described using an instance of a subclass of StateAndCondition (such as SupplyAndAvailability) with the :has_holder property referencing the farmer and the fruit (a sub-class of Resource) defined using the :has_topic property." .
