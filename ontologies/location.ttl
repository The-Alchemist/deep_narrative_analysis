:BoundingBox a owl:Class ;

  rdfs:comment "Note that GeopoliticalEntity is defined as both a PhysicalLocation and an Actor. This is due to its usage in text and conversation. For example, one may say 'California is in the western United States, and is considered to be quite liberal.' In that sentence, California is both a location, and an entity (Actor) that has a political orientation. Distinguishing the difference between these semantics is quite difficult, and usually unnecessary. Hence, GeopoliticalEntity is defined by multiple inheritance.
