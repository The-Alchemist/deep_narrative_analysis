    "\n",
    "Purpose is to create the geonames-featureCodes.ttl file from the featureCodes_en.txt file, downloaded from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before processing, the featureCodes_en.txt file was modified to:\n",
    "  * Change all class-dot-code ids to class-underscore-code\n",
    "  * Add super-class definition(s) \n",
    "    * This could be changed to create a default (flat) mapping based only on the feature class, but a greater level of hypernymy was desired\n",
    "  * Remove codes where their semantics were identical to the class  or where the semantics were only plurals of an existing (singular) code \n",
    "    * As an example of the first, P.PPL is equivalent to the feature class, 'P' ('Populated Place') and was removed\n",
    "    * As an example of the second, S.HUTS is the plural of S.HUT and can be expressed in the Narrative ontology as S_HUT + setting the 'plural' predicate to True\n",
    "      * Unfortunately, most locations are not separately labeled as unique singular and plural codes\n",
    "  * Modify descriptions to begin with a capital letter and to be singular\n",
    "    * Where a description was not provided, the label was copied\n",
    "\n",
    "After completion, the geonames-featureCodes.ttl file was split into separate GeoName feature class files (to be more modular), and synonyms were added. The resulting files were moved to the ../Ontologies directory."
